      "<p>Jassa Ahluwalia's <strong>Both Not Half</strong> is a memoir that delves into the complexities of identity, belonging, and self-discovery. As a reader with an interest in personal narratives that explore cultural intersections, I approached this book with anticipation. However, while the book offers some engaging anecdotes and insightful reflections, it ultimately left me with mixed feelings. In this review, I will explore the strengths and weaknesses of <strong>Both Not Half, </strong>focusing on the writing style, narrative structure, and thematic exploration.</p><p>Writing Style</p><p>One of the most significant challenges I encountered while reading <strong>Both Not Half</strong>  was the writing style. Ahluwalia's prose often felt disjointed, with frequent shifts in focus that disrupted the narrative flow. This inconsistency made it difficult to fully immerse myself in his story. While each chapter aimed to tackle different aspects of his identity journey, the transitions were often abrupt, leaving me wanting more coherence and depth.</p><p>The language itself, though occasionally poignant, lacked the polish and finesse that could have elevated the memoir. There were moments where Ahluwalia's reflections were insightful and thought-provoking, but these were overshadowed by a lack of narrative cohesion. A more structured approach might have allowed for a more impactful exploration of his themes.</p><p>Narrative Structure</p><p>The structure of <strong>Both Not Half</strong> is another area where the book struggled to maintain its footing. The memoir attempts to cover a wide range of topics&#8212;from cultural identity to family dynamics&#8212;but often does so without a clear roadmap. This lack of focus can leave readers feeling lost amidst the myriad of themes and anecdotes.</p><p>Ahluwalia's decision to jump between different periods of his life without clear transitions contributed to this sense of disarray. While his intention might have been to illustrate the fragmented nature of identity exploration, it often resulted in a fragmented reading experience as well. A more linear or thematically organized structure could have provided clarity and helped readers connect more deeply with his journey.</p><p>Childhood Stories</p><p>Despite these challenges, one aspect of <strong>Both Not Half</strong> that stood out positively was Ahluwalia's recounting of his childhood experiences. These stories were not only relatable but also infused with humor and warmth. His ability to capture the innocence and curiosity of youth brought a refreshing lightness to the narrative.</p><p>Ahluwalia's childhood tales are peppered with amusing anecdotes that highlight his unique perspective growing up in a multicultural environment. Whether it's navigating cultural expectations or dealing with misunderstandings among peers, these stories are both entertaining and enlightening. They offer a glimpse into the formative experiences that shaped his understanding of identity.</p><p>Thematic Exploration</p><p>At its core, <strong>Both Not Half</strong> aims to explore themes of identity and belonging&#8212;a universal struggle for many who straddle multiple cultures. Ahluwalia's insights into these themes are valuable, yet they often feel underdeveloped due to the book's structural issues.</p><p>The memoir touches on important topics such as racial identity, cultural heritage, and self-acceptance. However, these explorations sometimes lack depth and fail to provide new perspectives or solutions. While Ahluwalia's personal journey is compelling, it would have benefited from a more focused analysis or broader contextualization within societal frameworks.</p><p><strong>Both Not Half</strong> by Jassa Ahluwalia is a memoir that offers glimpses into the complexities of cultural identity through humorous childhood stories and personal reflections. However, its potential is hindered by inconsistent writing and an unfocused narrative structure. While there are moments of insight and entertainment, they are often overshadowed by the book's lack of cohesion.</p><p>For readers interested in personal narratives about identity exploration, this memoir may still hold appeal&#8212;particularly for those who appreciate humor-infused storytelling. However, those seeking a more polished and cohesive exploration might find themselves yearning for greater depth and clarity.</p><p>With its strengths and weaknesses considered, I would rate *Both Not Half* three out of five stars. It is an ambitious work that offers valuable insights but ultimately falls short in its execution.</p>",

He takes readers on a journey through the twenty-three chapters of the book, each dedicated to a specific chromosome, unveiling the marvels and mysteries of the human genome. The author\'s ability to explain complex concepts in an accessible manner is commendable, making this book suitable for readers with varying levels of scientific knowledge.</p><p>"Genome" presents a wealth of fascinating facts that illuminate our understanding of genetics. Ridley explores a wide range of topics, from the genetic basis of disease to the origins of human behavior, providing readers with a comprehensive overview of our species\' genetic heritage. He introduces us to the intricacies of DNA sequencing, the roles of genes in shaping our traits, and the interplay between nature and nurture in shaping our lives. The book is enriched with thought-provoking examples and case studies that highlight the real-world implications of genetic discoveries.</p><p>However, one aspect of the book that falls short is the final chapter, where Ridley attempts to discuss "the gene for free will." While the topic is undoubtedly intriguing, the author\'s approach in this chapter feels somewhat forced and speculative. Ridley ventures into philosophical territory without providing concrete evidence or a strong scientific foundation to support his claims. This departure from the otherwise factual and evidence-based nature of the book is somewhat jarring and might leave readers expecting a more substantive exploration of the subject.</p><p>To improve the book, Ridley could have approached the concept of free will in a more balanced and nuanced manner. By incorporating a broader range of perspectives from both genetics and philosophy, he could have fostered a more meaningful dialogue on this complex topic. A more comprehensive discussion would have added depth and credibility to the book\'s overall exploration of the human genome.</p><p>"Genome: The Autobiography of a Species in 23 Chapters" still deserves a solid rating of 3.8 to 4 stars out of 5. Ridley\'s engrossing writing style and the wealth of factual information presented make this book a valuable resource for anyone curious about the complexities of our genetic blueprint. However, the shortcomings in the final chapter prevent it from reaching its full potential. Despite this, it remains a worthwhile read for those with a genuine interest in genetics and a willingness to engage critically with the subject matter.</p>',

One such moment is the cognitive revolution, which occurred around 70,000 years ago when Homo sapiens acquired the ability to think and communicate in unprecedented ways. This cognitive leap paved the way for the emergence of complex social structures and cooperation, driving our species forward.</p><p>Another crucial aspect Harari delves into is the Agricultural Revolution. Around 12,000 years ago, humans transitioned from nomadic hunting and gathering societies to settled agricultural communities. This revolution fundamentally transformed our way of life, leading to the rise of civilization, the development of cities, and the birth of agriculture as a foundation for human sustenance.</p><p>Throughout the book, Harari challenges conventional wisdom and offers insightful perspectives. He explores the concept of money as a collective fiction, highlighting its role in facilitating economic exchanges and cooperation on a large scale.

Casey introduces John to the concept of the five questions, which are essential for finding purpose in life. These questions are:</p><ul><li><p>What is your purpose?</p></li><li><p>Why are you here?</p></li><li><p>Do you fear death?</p></li><li><p>Are you fulfilled?</p></li><li><p>Would you rather be right or happy?</p></li></ul><p>Through these questions, John realizes that he has been living a life that is not aligned with his purpose. He decides to make changes in his life, starting with his career.</p><h2>Pursuing Happiness</h2><p>Another important theme in the novel is the pursuit of happiness. John learns that happiness is not something that can be bought or achieved through external means. Instead, it is something that comes from within. He realizes that he has been chasing after material possessions and success, but these things have not brought him true happiness.</p><p>At the cafe, John meets other characters who have pursued happiness in different ways. Each character has a unique story and perspective on life, but they all share the same desire for happiness and fulfillment.</p><h2>Embracing the Unknown</h2><p>The cafe on the edge of the world is a metaphor for the unknown and the uncertain. John learns that it is okay to not have all the answers and to embrace the unknown. He realizes that life is a journey, and the destination is not always clear.</p><p>The conclusion of the novel emphasizes the importance of embracing the unknown. John realizes that the cafe on the edge of the world was not just a physical place, but a state of mind. He understands that he can access this state of mind anytime he wants, by embracing the unknown and living in the present moment. The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a thought-provoking novel that encourages readers to reflect on their lives and find their purpose and happiness.</p><p><strong>2/5 stars</strong></p><p>This novel tells the story of a man who finds purpose and happiness at a cafe on the edge of the world. While the themes of purpose, meaning, and happiness are important, the execution falls short. The characters are not well-developed, and the dialogue can be contrived and preachy at times. The concept of the five questions is interesting, but it feels too simplistic and formulaic. The pursuit of happiness is a worthy goal, but the novel\'s portrayal of it feels naive and idealistic. Overall, The Cafe on the Edge of the World is a mediocre novel that fails to deliver on its promise.</p>',

This means that we tend to want what others want, and this can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the context.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg" width="263" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:263,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!LjDh!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F863a4242-942b-41ac-b610-30d2d863e4fb_263x400.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p>On the one hand, mimetic desire can inspire us to pursue positive goals and to better ourselves. For example, we may see someone we admire who has achieved great success in their career, and we may be motivated to work hard to achieve similar success. Mimetic desire can also inspire us to be more compassionate, kind, and generous, as we may see others exhibiting these qualities and want to emulate them.</p><p>However, on the other hand, mimetic desire can also lead to negative consequences. For example, we may become envious of someone who has something that we want, and this can lead to feelings of resentment and bitterness. We may also engage in rivalry with others, seeking to outdo them in order to prove our worth. In extreme cases, mimetic desire can even lead to violence, as we may be willing to harm others in order to achieve our desires.</p><p>Wanting is a thought-provoking book that explores the concept of mimetic desire. The author, Luke Burgis, argues that our desires are shaped by the desires of other people around us. He explains how we unconsciously mimic the desires of those we admire, leading to a never-ending cycle of wanting.</p><p>Burgis draws on examples from various fields, including psychology, philosophy, economics, and literature, to demonstrate the power of mimetic desire in our everyday lives. He also examines the negative consequences of mimetic desire, such as envy, rivalry, and violence.</p><p>One of the most important points in the book is that mimetic desire is not necessarily a bad thing. Burgis argues that it can be a powerful force for positive change when it is channeled properly. He suggests that we can use our mimetic desire to pursue worthy goals and to inspire others to do the same.</p><p>Overall, mimetic desire is a powerful force that can shape our lives in both positive and negative ways. It is important to be aware of this tendency and to use it wisely, channeling it towards positive goals and avoiding the negative consequences of envy, rivalry, and violence.</p><p>Wanting is a fascinating and insightful book that offers a fresh perspective on the nature of desire and its role in shaping our lives. It is a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, philosophy, or personal development.</p>',

In fact, it\'s one of the most endearing books I\'ve ever read. The characters are so relatable, and the author does an exceptional job of developing each character and their relationships with each other.</p><p>Don Tillman is a charming and lovable character. He has a unique personality, with his quirks, intelligence, and determination to improve his life and those around him. Don is a professor of genetics who struggles with social interaction due to his Asperger\'s Syndrome. He is also a devoted husband who is willing to go to great lengths to help his wife, Rosie, and their unborn child.</p><p>Rosie is Don\'s wife, and she is equally delightful as Don. She is smart, funny, and independent, and she shares a deep bond with Don. Rosie is a psychology student in the book and is determined to help Don overcome his social challenges. She is also pregnant, which adds to the complexity of their relationship.</p><p>Gene is Don\'s friend and colleague, and he is an important character in the book. He is a free-spirited and fun-loving person who provides a good contrast to Don\'s more reserved personality. Gene is also a significant source of support for Don and Rosie throughout the book.</p><p>One important moment in the book is when Don discovers that he is going to be a father, which leads to a series of events that test his relationship with Rosie. Another important moment is when Don tries to help his friend Gene with his own relationship problems, which ultimately leads to a falling out between them. The book also explores the importance of friendship, which is a recurring theme throughout the story.</p><p>What I particularly enjoyed about this book is how the author infused humor into the story while still managing to tackle important themes. Graeme Simsion\'s writing style is simply amazing. He has a way of tackling important human emotions with his funny writing style that leaves you laughing and feeling good about life. The way he blends humor and heartwarming moments in the story is absolutely brilliant. I found myself giggling and grinning throughout the book and sometimes shedding a tear or two. The story is not just hilarious, but it\'s also heartfelt and touching.</p><p>Overall, The Rosie Effect is an absolute masterpiece that I would give a 5 out of 5 stars rating. Graeme Simsion\'s exceptional writing style combined with a heartwarming story makes this book a must-read for anyone who loves to read. This book is a perfect escapism read, especially in these times where we need something to make us forget our worries and stress. Trust me, you won\'t regret reading this book. It\'s a book that you will want to share with your friends and family.</p>',

The book takes a deep dive into Don&#8217;s diagnosis with Asperger&#8217;s syndrome, and how it affects his life, relationships, and work. However, the author doesn\'t dwell too much on the diagnosis, and instead, focuses on how Don deals with it and moves forward. This approach makes the story relatable and inspiring, as it shows that people can overcome their challenges if they have the right mindset and support system.</p><h2>Raising Children with Comedy</h2><p>Another significant theme in The Rosie Result is Don and Rosie&#8217;s journey of raising their son, Hudson. The book touches on issues such as education, parenting, and family dynamics. However, what makes this story unique is the way it balances these heavy topics with humor. Simsion\'s writing style is witty and sarcastic, which adds a layer of comedy to the story without taking away from the seriousness of the issues at hand.</p><h2>A Great Balance</h2><p>Overall, The Rosie Result is a perfectly balanced read. The book tackles important topics, but does so in a way that doesn\'t feel overwhelming or too heavy. The comedy element keeps the story engaging and enjoyable, while the underlying themes of health and raising children provide depth and substance. Simsion\'s writing style is a delight to read, and he manages to create a perfect balance between the serious and the comedic.</p><p>The Rosie Result is a must-read for anyone looking for a book that touches on important topics like health and raising children, while maintaining an element of comedy and a great story. Simsion\'s writing style is engaging, and his ability to balance serious themes with humor is what makes this book so enjoyable. If you haven\'t read The Rosie Result yet, I highly recommend that you do.</p>',

She learns to read with the help of her foster father, Hans Hubermann, and starts stealing books from book burnings and the mayor\'s wife\'s library. The books she reads inspire her and provide her with a means of escape from the harsh reality of her life in Nazi Germany.</p><p>Another important theme in the book is the power of words. Liesel\'s love for books and reading leads her to write her own story, which she leaves behind for others to read. The book also highlights the power of words in propaganda and how they can be used to manipulate and control people.</p><p>The Book Thief also explores the lives of ordinary Germans during the war. It shows the struggles and hardships they faced, as well as the fear and paranoia that permeated everyday life. The book also portrays the role of the Hitler Youth and how they were indoctrinated with propaganda and hatred from a young age.</p><p>I recently read The Book Thief by Markus Zusak, and I have to say that it was one of the most boring books I have ever read. I found myself constantly fighting the urge to stop reading it, but I persevered with the hope that it would get better. Unfortunately, it never did.</p><p>The main issue I had with this book was the writing style. It was so poor that it made me wonder how it even got published in the first place. The sentences were overly long and convoluted, making it difficult to follow the plot. The dialogue was stilted and unrealistic, and the characters were one-dimensional and lacked depth.</p><p>What\'s even more surprising is that The Book Thief has won several awards for its unique narrative style. I find this hard to believe, as the writing is so bad that it\'s hard to fathom how it won anything at all. It\'s almost as if the judges were more impressed with the concept of the book rather than the actual execution of it.</p><p>Apart from the poor writing style, the plot itself was uneventful and uninspiring. The story follows a young girl named Liesel who steals books during Nazi Germany and learns to read. The idea of a book about a young girl who loves books and reading was intriguing to me, but the execution fell flat. The story lacked any real emotional depth, and the characters were forgettable.</p><p>Overall, I wouldn\'t recommend this book to anyone. If you\'re looking for a good read, The Book Thief is not it. It\'s a shame because the concept had potential, but the execution was lacklustre. Save yourself the time and find something else to read.</p>',

    title: 'Book Review: "Dune" by Frank Herbert',

      '<p>"Dune" by Frank Herbert is often hailed as a science fiction masterpiece, but I found it to be a bewildering and frustrating experience. Despite its reputation and ambitious scope, the novel fell short in several key areas, making it a challenging read that didn\'t always reward the effort.</p><p>One of the most significant issues I encountered with "Dune" was its excessive use of jargon. Herbert introduces a plethora of terms and concepts unique to the world of Arrakis, from the intricacies of the spice melange to the political and religious structures governing the galaxy. While these details are intended to immerse the reader in a rich and complex universe, they often did the opposite for me. The constant need to reference the glossary or contextually decipher the meaning of unfamiliar terms was tiresome and detracted from my overall reading experience.</p><p>The storytelling approach in "Dune" also contributed to my confusion. Herbert alternates between dense, expository narration and dialogue-heavy scenes without a clear or consistent flow. This disjointed structure made it difficult for me to follow the plot and understand character motivations. Key events and developments sometimes felt abrupt or inadequately explained, leaving me struggling to piece together the narrative threads.</p><p>Moreover, I found the novel\'s pacing to be uneven. Moments of intense action and intrigue are interspersed with long, ponderous sections that delve into philosophical musings or intricate political machinations. While these elements are integral to the story\'s depth, their presentation often felt heavy-handed and disrupted the narrative momentum for me.</p><p>While "Dune" is undeniably ambitious and has garnered a dedicated fanbase, it is not without its flaws. The heavy use of jargon and the erratic storytelling made it a confusing and arduous read for me. For those seeking a more accessible and smoothly flowing narrative, "Dune" may prove to be a disappointment. Thus, I give it a modest 2 out of 5 stars in my review.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg" width="599" height="900" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:900,&quot;width&quot;:599,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:534234,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Nebn!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F95931805-0976-4461-8d47-14b6c3eefef3_599x900.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div><p></p>',

which allows developers to write SQL queries in a readable and expressive manner. Unlike traditional string-based SQL queries, jOOQ\'s fluent API provides type-safety, code completion, and compile-time checks, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall code quality.</p><pre><code>Result&lt;Record&gt; result = dsl.select(BOOK.TITLE, BOOK.AUTHOR)\n\n                           .from(BOOK)\n\n                           .where(BOOK.PUBLISHED_YEAR.gt(2010))\n\n                           .orderBy(BOOK.TITLE)\n\n                           .fetch();</code></pre><p>The code above demonstrates a simple SELECT query using jOOQ\'s fluent API. It reads like plain English, making it easy to understand and maintain, even for developers who are new to the codebase.</p><h3>Spring/Spring Boot Integration: Seamless and Effortless</h3><p>jOOQ\'s integration with Spring and Spring Boot is a breeze, thanks to the `spring-boot-starter-jooq` dependency. By simply adding this dependency to your project, Spring Boot will automatically configure the `DSLContext` bean, allowing you to inject it into your components using constructor injection or field injection.</p><pre><code>&lt;dependency&gt;\n\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.springframework.boot&lt;/groupId&gt;\n\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;spring-boot-starter-jooq&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n\n&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre><p>With this configuration, you can start using jOOQ in your Spring Boot application without any additional setup. It\'s as simple as injecting the `DSLContext` into your service or repository classes.</p><pre><code>import org.jooq.DSLContext;\n\nimport org.springframework.stereotype.Service;\n\n@Service\n\npublic class BookService {\n\n    private final DSLContext dslContext;\n\n    public BookService(DSLContext dslContext) {\n\n        this.dslContext = dslContext;\n\n    }\n\n    // Use the dslContext to execute jOOQ queries\n\n}</code></pre><h3>Lightweight and Nimble: Efficient Database Interaction</h3><p>One of the key advantages of jOOQ is its lightweight nature. Unlike some persistence frameworks that can feel bloated and resource-intensive, jOOQ is nimble and efficient, allowing your application to perform database operations without unnecessary overhead.</p><p>Despite its lightweight design, jOOQ packs a powerful punch when it comes to features and functionality. From code generation to database migration, jOOQ has got you covered, ensuring that your database interactions are smooth and efficient.</p><h3>Outperforming Hibernate and JPA: Leveraging Database-Specific Features</h3><p>While Hibernate and JPA have long been the go-to choices for Java persistence, jOOQ offers a compelling alternative by leveraging database-specific features and optimizations. By embracing SQL as the primary language for database interaction, jOOQ can often outperform its heavyweight counterparts in terms of performance and flexibility.</p><p>Additionally, jOOQ provides a unique section on their website called "Convince Your Manager" &#8211; a very informative PDF that presents a compelling case for adopting jOOQ in your organization. It\'s a great way to introduce jOOQ to your team and potentially persuade stakeholders to consider this powerful persistence solution.</p><p>By the way, I find it funny to have something like this for your users &#129315;</p><h3>Extensions and Plugins: Enhancing Productivity</h3><p>jOOQ offers a wide range of extensions and plugins that can significantly enhance developer productivity and streamline database-related tasks. From database migration tools to code generation wizardry, jOOQ has a plethora of options to make your life easier and your code more efficient.</p><p>For example, jOOQ\'s code generation tools can generate code directly from your database schema, ensuring that your Java classes accurately reflect the structure of your database. This not only saves time but also reduces the risk of errors and inconsistencies.</p><pre><code>&lt;plugin&gt;\n\n    &lt;groupId&gt;org.jooq&lt;/groupId&gt;\n\n    &lt;artifactId&gt;jooq-codegen-maven&lt;/artifactId&gt;\n\n    &lt;version&gt;${jooq.version}&lt;/version&gt;\n\n    &lt;executions&gt;\n\n        &lt;execution&gt;\n\n            &lt;goals&gt;\n\n                &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;\n\n            &lt;/goals&gt;\n\n        &lt;/execution&gt;\n\n    &lt;/executions&gt;\n\n    &lt;configuration&gt;\n\n        &lt;jdbc&gt;\n\n            &lt;driver&gt;com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver&lt;/driver&gt;\n\n            &lt;url&gt;jdbc:mysql://localhost/testdb&lt;/url&gt;\n\n            &lt;user&gt;root&lt;/user&gt;\n\n            &lt;password&gt;secret&lt;/password&gt;\n\n        &lt;/jdbc&gt;\n\n        &lt;generator&gt;\n\n            &lt;database&gt;\n\n                &lt;name&gt;org.jooq.meta.mysql.MySQLDatabase&lt;/name&gt;\n\n                &lt;includes&gt;.*&lt;/includes&gt;\n\n                &lt;inputSchema&gt;testdb&lt;/inputSchema&gt;\n\n            &lt;/database&gt;\n\n            &lt;target&gt;\n\n                &lt;packageName&gt;com.example.jooq&lt;/packageName&gt;\n\n                &lt;directory&gt;src/main/java&lt;/directory&gt;\n\n            &lt;/target&gt;\n\n        &lt;/generator&gt;\n\n    &lt;/configuration&gt;\n\n&lt;/plugin&gt;</code></pre><p>The above configuration demonstrates how to set up jOOQ\'s code generation plugin for a Maven project, generating Java classes from a MySQL database schema.</p><h3>My Journey: From Hibernate and JPA to jOOQ</h3><p>As a seasoned Java developer, I\'ve had my fair share of experiences with various persistence frameworks, including Hibernate and JPA. While these frameworks have their strengths, they also come with their own set of challenges and complexities.</p><p>In the early days of my career, I found myself spending countless hours trying to debug and understand the internals of Hibernate and JPA, often feeling like I was fighting against the framework rather than working with it. The abstraction layers and magic behind these frameworks, while powerful, sometimes made it difficult to reason about what was happening under the hood.</p><p>One particular incident that stands out in my memory was a seemingly simple task that turned into a nightmare. I was trying to perform a complex join query with Hibernate, and the generated SQL was so convoluted and inefficient that it brought our production database to its knees. After hours of debugging and tweaking configurations, I realized that the problem stemmed from Hibernate\'s inability to optimize the query for our specific database schema and use case.</p><p>It was then that I started exploring alternative solutions, and jOOQ caught my attention. At first, I was skeptical about abandoning the familiar territory of Hibernate and JPA, but as I delved deeper into jOOQ\'s fluent API and its ability to leverage database-specific features, I was hooked.</p><p>With jOOQ, I no longer had to wrestle with abstraction layers or rely on magic to generate SQL queries. Instead, I could write SQL directly in my Java code, leveraging the full power and optimization capabilities of the underlying database. The fluent API made my code more readable and maintainable, and the compile-time checks and type-safety provided an additional layer of confidence in my database interactions.</p><p>One particular feature of jOOQ that I grew to appreciate was its code generation capabilities. By generating Java classes directly from my database schema, I could ensure that my code accurately reflected the structure of the database, reducing the risk of errors and inconsistencies.</p><p>Over time, I became a firm believer in jOOQ\'s approach to database interaction, and I\'ve never looked back. While Hibernate and JPA still have their place in certain scenarios, jOOQ has become my go-to choice for projects where performance, flexibility, and maintainability are paramount.</p><h3><strong>Final thoughts</strong></h3><p>jOOQ is a powerful and lightweight persistence solution that offers a fluent and expressive API for database interaction. Its seamless integration with Spring and Spring Boot, combined with its efficient and nimble design, make it a compelling choice for Java developers.</p><p>While jOOQ may not be as widely adopted as Hibernate or JPA, its ability to leverage database-specific features and optimizations can often result in improved performance and flexibility. Additionally, jOOQ\'s extensive set of extensions and plugins can significantly enhance developer productivity and streamline database-related tasks.</p><p>Whether you\'re building a new application or looking to improve the performance of an existing one, jOOQ is definitely worth considering. With its elegant syntax, efficient design, and powerful features, jOOQ can be a game-changer for your Java persistence needs.</p>',

It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for Docker, offering a similar user experience and command-line interface (CLI). However, Podman has several key differences that set it apart from its more established counterpart.</p><p>One of the most significant advantages of Podman is its daemonless architecture. Unlike Docker, which requires a long-running daemon process, Podman operates without a persistent daemon. This means that each Podman command is executed as a separate process, reducing the attack surface and improving overall security.</p><p><strong>Security: Podman\'s Forte</strong></p><p>Security is a critical concern in the world of containerization, and Podman excels in this area. By eliminating the need for a persistent daemon, Podman significantly reduces the risk of security vulnerabilities associated with long-running processes. Additionally, Podman employs robust security measures, such as rootless containers and user namespaces, which allow non-root users to run containers with enhanced isolation and reduced privileges.</p><p>Rootless containers are a game-changer in the containerization landscape. With Podman, users can run containers without requiring root privileges, which is a common requirement for Docker. This feature not only enhances security by limiting the potential damage caused by compromised containers but also simplifies the deployment process, as it eliminates the need for complex privilege management.</p><p><strong>Improved Compatibility and Portability</strong></p><p>One of the key strengths of Podman is its adherence to industry standards, such as the Open Container Initiative (OCI) and the Container Runtime Interface (CRI-O). This commitment to open standards ensures that Podman containers are compatible with a wide range of container runtimes and orchestration platforms, including Kubernetes.</p><p>Furthermore, Podman\'s compatibility with Docker containers and images makes it a seamless transition for developers and administrators already familiar with Docker. Podman can pull, run, and manage Docker containers and images without any modifications, ensuring a smooth migration path and minimizing disruptions to existing workflows.</p><p><strong>Efficient Resource Utilization</strong></p><p>Podman\'s daemonless architecture not only enhances security but also contributes to efficient resource utilization. Without a persistent daemon process, Podman consumes fewer system resources, making it an attractive choice for resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or embedded systems.</p><p>Additionally, Podman\'s support for rootless containers further optimizes resource usage by eliminating the need for privileged access and reducing the overhead associated with running containers as root.</p><p><strong>Seamless Integration with Kubernetes</strong></p><p>As the adoption of Kubernetes continues to grow, the need for a container runtime that seamlessly integrates with the popular orchestration platform becomes increasingly important. Podman, with its support for CRI-O (the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface), is well-positioned to meet this demand.</p><p>CRI-O is a lightweight, OCI-compliant container runtime designed specifically for Kubernetes. By leveraging CRI-O, Podman can seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes, enabling developers and administrators to manage and orchestrate containers within the Kubernetes ecosystem.</p><p><strong>Simplified Debugging and Troubleshooting</strong></p><p>Debugging and troubleshooting containerized applications can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with complex architectures and multiple containers. Podman simplifies this process by providing enhanced visibility and control over container processes.</p><p>With Podman, each container runs as a separate process, making it easier to monitor and inspect individual containers. Additionally, Podman offers powerful debugging tools, such as the ability to attach to running containers, inspect container processes, and access container logs directly, without the need for additional tools or plugins.</p><p><strong>Robust Ecosystem and Community Support</strong></p><p>Despite being a relatively new player in the containerization space, Podman has already garnered significant support from the open-source community and major industry players. Red Hat, the company behind Podman, has invested heavily in its development and actively contributes to the project.</p><p>Furthermore, Podman is part of the broader OCI ecosystem, which includes projects like Buildah (for building OCI-compliant images), Skopeo (for working with remote image registries), and CRI-O (for integrating with Kubernetes). This robust ecosystem provides developers and administrators with a comprehensive set of tools for managing the entire container lifecycle.</p><p><strong>Getting Started with Podman</strong></p><p>If you\'re convinced that Podman is the right choice for your containerization needs, getting started is straightforward. Podman is available for various Linux distributions, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), CentOS, Fedora, and Ubuntu.</p><p>To install Podman on a RHEL or CentOS system, you can use the following command:</p><pre><code>sudo yum install podman</code></pre><p>For Fedora, use:</p><pre><code>sudo dnf install podman</code></pre><p>And for Ubuntu, use:</p><pre><code>sudo apt-get install podman</code></pre><p>Once installed, you can start using Podman with commands similar to Docker. For example, to pull an image from a registry, you can use:</p><pre><code>podman pull &lt;image_name&gt;</code></pre><p>To run a container from the pulled image, use:</p><pre><code>podman run &lt;image_name&gt;</code></pre><p>Podman\'s CLI is designed to be familiar to Docker users, making the transition smoother and reducing the learning curve.</p><p><strong>My Learning</strong></p><p>As someone who has been working with Docker for several years, the transition to Podman was initially daunting. However, after spending some time exploring its features and capabilities, I quickly realized the potential benefits it offers.One of the first things that struck me about Podman was its emphasis on security. The daemonless architecture and rootless containers were game-changers for me, as they addressed some of the long-standing security concerns I had with Docker. I no longer had to worry about the potential risks associated with a long-running daemon process or the need for privileged access to run containers.Another aspect that impressed me was Podman\'s compatibility with Docker containers and images. This seamless integration allowed me to leverage my existing Docker knowledge and workflows, minimizing the learning curve and ensuring a smooth transition.Initially, I was skeptical about Podman\'s resource efficiency claims, but after running some tests and benchmarks, I was pleasantly surprised. Podman\'s lightweight nature and efficient resource utilization were evident, especially in resource-constrained environments where every bit of optimization counts.One area where I encountered a slight learning curve was the integration with Kubernetes. While Podman\'s support for CRI-O is a significant advantage, understanding the intricacies of this integration took some time and effort. However, once I got the hang of it, the benefits of seamlessly managing containers within the Kubernetes ecosystem became apparent.Overall, my learning experience with Podman has been incredibly positive. It has opened my eyes to the possibilities of a more secure, efficient, and standards-compliant containerization solution. While there may be a slight learning curve for those deeply entrenched in the Docker ecosystem, the benefits of Podman make it a worthwhile investment of time and effort.</p><p><strong>Summing it up</strong></p><p>Podman is a powerful and innovative container engine that offers a compelling alternative to Docker. With its focus on security, compatibility, and efficient resource utilization, Podman is well-positioned to meet the evolving needs of the containerization landscape.</p><p>Whether you\'re a developer, system administrator, or a DevOps professional, Podman is worth considering for your containerization needs. Its daemonless architecture, rootless containers, and seamless integration with Kubernetes make it a versatile and future-proof solution.</p><p>As the containerization ecosystem continues to evolve, Podman\'s commitment to open standards and its robust community support ensure that it will remain a relevant and influential player in the years to come.</p>',

      "Unraveling the Enigma: Boredom, Anxiety, and the Quest for Existential Meaning. A review of the article by Markham Heid.",

      '<p>Have you ever found yourself gripped by an inexplicable sense of ennui, a profound boredom that seeps into the very fabric of your being, despite having all the trappings of a seemingly perfect life? It\'s a paradoxical state, where the world around you remains unchanged, yet the familiar sights, sounds, and experiences that once brought joy and fulfilment now leave you feeling hollow and disengaged.</p><p>Markham Heid, in his thought-provoking <strong><a href="https://time.com/6975668/boredom-anxiety-philosophy-essay/">article</a></strong> for Time Magazine, shares his own encounter with this existential malaise, a "mid-life melancholy" that struck him unexpectedly. He writes, </p><blockquote><p>I had a good job, a loving family, and a comfortable home in a pleasant neighborhood. And yet, I often felt a sense of ennui, a kind of free-floating dissatisfaction with life.</p></blockquote><p>This sentiment echoes the profound musings of Jean-Paul Sartre\'s seminal novel "Nausea," where the protagonist, Antoine Roquentin, finds himself overwhelmed by a sense of disquiet when confronted with the sheer ordinariness of everyday objects. Sartre\'s words resonate deeply: </p><blockquote><p>Existence is a fullness which man can never accomplish. When he is most sincere, when he practises his trade as a simple being, he knows there is something still left over.</p></blockquote><h4>The Existential Angst of Being</h4><p>Boredom and anxiety, though seemingly disparate emotions, are inextricably intertwined in the philosophical discourse on existential angst. Martin Heidegger, the renowned German philosopher, delved into the uncanny unease we may feel when bored, seeking distractions to fill the void. He posited that boredom is not merely a lack of stimulation but a profound encounter with the very essence of our being.</p><p>In his seminal work "Being and Time," Heidegger writes, </p><blockquote><p>Profound boredom, drifting here and there in the abysses of our existence like a muffling fog, removes all things and human beings and oneself along with it into a remarkable indifference.</p></blockquote><p>This indifference, this detachment from the world around us, can be a gateway to a deeper understanding of our existence.</p><p>S&#248;ren Kierkegaard, the Danish philosopher and theologian, spoke of a "silent despair" that lurks in the background of our lives, a dread of something unknown that can suddenly grab us and shake us to our core. In his work "The Concept of Anxiety," he writes, </p><blockquote><p>Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom, which emerges when the spirit wants to posit the synthesis and freedom looks down into its own possibility, laying hold of finiteness to support itself.</p></blockquote><h4>The Existential Void and the Search for Meaning</h4><p>What is striking, as Heidegger observed, is that these intense emotions can arise even when nothing has changed in our external circumstances. We remain surrounded by the same people, events, and activities, yet they no longer engage us as before. It is as if a veil has been lifted, revealing the underlying emptiness that permeates our existence.</p><p>Heid aptly captures this sentiment, stating, </p><blockquote><p>Some essential aspect of life is missing or not sufficiently engaged.</p></blockquote><p>This realization can be both unsettling and liberating, for it prompts us to question the very foundations upon which we have built our lives.</p><p>Jean-Paul Sartre\'s philosophy of existentialism offers a poignant perspective on this existential void. In his seminal work "Being and Nothingness," he asserts, </p><blockquote><p>Man is a useless passion. It arises from the renunciation of all truth, it is a passion for passion, born of the disappointment of all passions.</p></blockquote><p>Yet, within this seeming abyss of meaninglessness, Sartre also offers a glimmer of hope, a call to embrace our freedom and responsibility in shaping our own existence. He writes, </p><blockquote><p>Man is condemned to be free; because once thrown into the world, he is responsible for everything he does.</p></blockquote><h4>Embracing the Existential Journey</h4><p>Learning from these philosophical perspectives can help us discover a sense of peace and joy within the malaise of boredom and anxiety. It prompts us to reflect on what may be truly missing, to question the very foundations upon which we have built our lives, and to seek a deeper, more authentic connection with ourselves and the world around us.</p><p>As Heid poignantly concludes, </p><blockquote><p>The solution, then, is not to run from boredom or anxiety, but to lean into them, to explore their depths and see what truths they might reveal about the human condition. </p></blockquote><p>In the words of Kierkegaard, </p><blockquote><p>The greatest hazard of all, losing one\'s self, can occur very quietly in the world, as if it were nothing at all. </p></blockquote><p>It is a call to embrace the existential journey, to confront the depths of our being, and to emerge with a renewed sense of purpose and authenticity.</p><p>By delving into the philosophical insights of thinkers like Heidegger, Kierkegaard, and Sartre, we can unravel the enigma of boredom, anxiety, and existential angst, and discover the profound truths that lie at the heart of the human experience.</p><div><hr></div><p><strong>References</strong>:</p><ul><li><p> Heid, M.

      '<p>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck, written by Mark Manson, is a self-help book that talks about living a satisfying life by focusing on what truly matters. The title might seem controversial, but the book is a refreshing take on the genre. I would rate it a 4 out of 5, as it offers valuable insights, but some chapters could have been more concise.</p><h2>The author\'s approach</h2><p>What sets this book apart from others in its category is the author\'s approach. Mark Manson doesn\'t believe in the traditional self-help mantra of positive thinking and affirmations. Instead, he advocates for embracing negative experiences and feelings and using them as motivation to live a fulfilling life. He argues that by accepting that life is not perfect, we can stop chasing unrealistic goals and focus on what truly matters.</p><h2>The value of the book</h2><p>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a thought-provoking read that challenges readers to reassess their priorities. The book offers practical advice on how to deal with adversity and create a more meaningful life. It\'s refreshing to read a self-help book that doesn\'t sugarcoat the realities of life and instead encourages readers to face them head-on.</p><h2>The author\'s writing style</h2><p>Mark Manson\'s writing style is engaging and humorous. He uses anecdotes and personal experiences to illustrate his points, which makes the book relatable and easy to read. While some chapters could have been more concise, the book is well-written and structured in a way that makes it easy to follow.</p><p>In conclusion, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck is a valuable addition to the self-help genre. Mark Manson\'s approach is refreshing, and his writing style is engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a new perspective on living a satisfying life.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg" width="267" height="400" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:400,&quot;width&quot;:267,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3ICW!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38c07711-594c-4e29-8d32-8ecf82c56a65_267x400.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div>',

      '<h2>Lack of Character Development</h2><p>One of the biggest flaws of this book is the lack of character development. The four main characters, the Liars, are supposed to be the heart of the story. However, their personalities are poorly developed, and the reader is left feeling disconnected and uninterested in their lives. The characters are one-dimensional, with no real depth to their personalities, and no clear motivations for their actions. As a result, the reader is unable to connect with them or care about their story.</p><h2>Predictable Plot Twist</h2><p>The plot twist in "We Were Liars" is supposed to be the highlight of the book. However, it is predictable and underwhelming. The twist is revealed in the last few pages, and by that point, the reader has already figured it out. This makes the whole book feel like a waste of time, as the reader is left feeling unsatisfied and disappointed.</p><h2>Poor Writing Style</h2><p>The writing style of "We Were Liars" is another reason why I gave it a low rating. The prose is overly simplistic, lacking in detail, and at times, confusing. The author tries to create a dream-like atmosphere, but instead, the writing comes across as vague and disjointed. This makes it difficult for the reader to fully immerse themselves in the story and connect with the characters.</p><p>In conclusion, "We Were Liars" is a book that failed to live up to its hype. The lack of character development, predictable plot twist, and poor writing style make it a tedious read. While it may have appealed to some readers, it was not a book that I enjoyed, and I cannot recommend it. Overall, I believe that "We Were Liars" deserves a 1 out of 5 stars rating.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-img" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg" width="314" height="475" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:475,&quot;width&quot;:314,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false,&quot;align&quot;:null,&quot;offset&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!MNxc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9cc2d0c4-7334-4249-b4dd-3c403c4e055d_314x475.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" fetchpriority="high"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><div class="pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset"><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image"><svg role="img" style="height:20px;width:20px" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 20 20" fill="none" stroke-width="1.5" stroke="var(--color-fg-primary)" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><g><title></title><path d="M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex="0" type="button" class="pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></button></div></div></div></a></figure></div>',

    description:
      "Acclaimed bestselling novelist Kunihiko Hidaka is found brutally murdered in his home on the night before he's planning to leave Japan and relocate to Vancouver. His body is found in his office, a locked room, within his locked house, by his wife and his best friend, both of whom have rock solid alibis. Or so it seems.<br /><br />At the crime scene, Police Detective Kyochiro Kaga recognizes Hidaka's best friend, Osamu Nonoguchi. Years ago when they were both teachers, they were colleagues at the same public school. Kaga went on to join the police force while Nonoguchi eventually left to become a full-time writer, though with not nearly the success of his friend Hidaka.<br /><br />As Kaga investigates, he eventually uncovers evidence that indicates that the two writers' relationship was very different that they claimed, that they were anything but best friends. But the question before Kaga isn't necessarily who, or how, but why. In a brilliantly realized tale of cat and mouse, the detective and the killer battle over the truth of the past and how events that led to the murder really unfolded. And if Kaga isn't able to uncover and prove why the murder was committed, then the truth may never come out.<br /><br /><i>Malice</i> is one of the bestselling―the most acclaimed―novel in Keigo Higashino's series featuring police detective Kyochiro Kaga, one of the most popular creations of the bestselling novelist in Asia.",

His ex-girlfriend's cat. A sadistic game show unlike anything in the universe: a dungeon crawl where survival depends on killing your prey in the most entertaining way possible.<br /><br />In a flash, every human-erected construction on Earth—from Buckingham Palace to the tiniest of sheds—collapses in a heap, sinking into the ground.<br /><br />The buildings and all the people inside have all been atomized and transformed into the dungeon: an 18-level labyrinth filled with traps, monsters, and loot. A dungeon so enormous, it circles the entire globe.<br /><br />Only a few dare venture inside. But once you're in, you can't get out. And what's worse, each level has a time limit. You have but days to find a staircase to the next level down, or it's game over. In this game, it's not about your strength or your dexterity. It's about your followers, your views. Your clout. It's about building an audience and killing those goblins with style.<br /><br /><b>You can't just survive here. You gotta survive big.</b><br /><br />You gotta fight with vigor, with excitement. You gotta make them stand up and cheer. And if you do have that \"it\" factor, you may just find yourself with a following.

He calls her name. For a moment, she pretends she hasn't heard him, but then, she turns, and a game begins: a legendary collaboration that will launch them to stardom.

Finishing this book and then forgetting about it is simply not an option.”—Janet Maslin, The New York Times</b><br /><br /><b>ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR: The New York Times Book Review, People, NPR, The Washington Post, Slate, Harper’s Bazaar, Time Out New York, Publishers Weekly, BookPage</b><br /><br /><b>An Oprah Daily Best Nonfiction Book of the Past Two Decades • A Kirkus Reviews Best Nonfiction Book of the Century</b><br /><br /><br />At the age of thirty-six, on the verge of completing a decade’s worth of training as a neurosurgeon, Paul Kalanithi was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. One day he was a doctor treating the dying, and the next he was a patient struggling to live. And just like that, the future he and his wife had imagined evaporated. <i>When Breath Becomes Air</i> chronicles Kalanithi’s transformation from a naïve medical student “possessed,” as he wrote, “by the question of what, given that all organisms die, makes a virtuous and meaningful life” into a neurosurgeon at Stanford working in the brain, the most critical place for human identity, and finally into a patient and new father confronting his own mortality.<br /><br />What makes life worth living in the face of death? What do you do when the future, no longer a ladder toward your goals in life, flattens out into a perpetual present? What does it mean to have a child, to nurture a new life as another fades away? These are some of the questions Kalanithi wrestles with in this profoundly moving, exquisitely observed memoir.<br /><br />Paul Kalanithi died in March 2015, while working on this book, yet his words live on as a guide and a gift to us all. “I began to realize that coming face to face with my own mortality, in a sense, had changed nothing and everything,” he wrote. “Seven words from Samuel Beckett began to repeat in my head: ‘I can’t go on. I’ll go on.’” When Breath Becomes Air is an unforgettable, life-affirming reflection on the challenge of facing death and on the relationship between doctor and patient, from a brilliant writer who became both.<br /><br /><b>Finalist for the PEN Center USA Literary Award in Creative Nonfiction and the Books for a Better Life Award in Inspirational Memoir</b>",

What is the difference between Jaya and Vijaya? Solve this puzzle and you will solve the mystery of the Mahabharata.<br /><br />In this enthralling retelling of India's greatest epic, the Mahabharata originally known as Jaya, Devdutt Pattanaik seamlessly weaves into a single narrative plots from the Sanskrit classic as well as its many folk and regional variants, including the Pandavani of Chhattisgarh, Gondhal of Maharashtra, Terukkuttu of Tamil Nadu and Yakshagana of Karnataka.<br /><br />Richly illustrated with over 250 line drawings by the author, the 108 chapters abound with little-known details such as the names of the hundred Kauravas, the worship of Draupadi as a goddess in Tamil Nadu, the stories of Astika, Madhavi, Jaimini, Aravan and Barbareek, the Mahabharata version of the Shakuntalam and the Ramayana, and the dating of the war based on astronomical data.<br /><br />With clarity and simplicity, the tales in this elegant volume reveal the eternal relevance of the Mahabharata, the complex and disturbing meditation on the human condition that has shaped Indian thought for over 3000 years.",

      'A searing, deeply moving memoir of illness and recovery that traces one young woman’s journey from diagnosis to remission and, ultimately, a road trip of healing and self-discovery.<br /><br />In the summer after graduating from college, Suleika Jaouad was preparing, as they say in commencement speeches, to enter "the real world". She had fallen in love and moved to Paris to pursue her dream of becoming a war correspondent. The real world she found, however, would take her into a very different kind of conflict zone.<br /><br />It started with an itch - first on her feet, then up her legs, like 1,000 invisible mosquito bites. Next came the exhaustion, and the six-hour naps that only deepened her fatigue. Then a trip to the doctor and, a few weeks shy of her 23rd birthday, a diagnosis: leukemia, with a 35 percent chance of survival. Just like that, the life she had imagined for herself had gone up in flames. By the time Jaouad flew home to New York, she had lost her job, her apartment, and her independence. She would spend much of the next four years in a hospital bed, fighting for her life and chronicling the saga in a column for The New York Times.<br /><br />When Jaouad finally walked out of the cancer ward - after three and a half years of chemo, a clinical trial, and a bone marrow transplant - she was, according to the doctors, cured. But as she would soon learn, a cure is not where the work of healing ends; it’s where it begins. She had spent the past 1,500 days in desperate pursuit of one goal - to survive. And now that she’d done so, she realized that she had no idea how to live.<br /><br />How would she reenter the world and live again? How could she reclaim what had been lost? Jaouad embarked - with her new best friend, Oscar, a scruffy terrier mutt - on a 100-day, 15,000-mile road trip across the country. She set out to meet some of the strangers who had written to her during her years in the hospital: a teenage girl in Florida also recovering from cancer; a teacher in California grieving the death of her son; a death-row inmate in Texas who’d spent his own years confined to a room. What she learned on this trip is that the divide between sick and well is porous, that the vast majority of us will travel back and forth between these realms throughout our lives. <em>Between Two Kingdoms</em> is a profound chronicle of survivorship and a fierce, tender, and inspiring exploration of what it means to begin again.',

    title: "The Message",
    description:
      "Ta-Nehisi Coates originally set off to write a book about writing, in the tradition of Orwell’s classic Politics and the English Language, but found himself grappling with deeper questions about how our stories—our reporting and imaginative narratives and mythmaking—expose and distort our realities. <br /><br />The first of the book’s three intertwining essays is set in Dakar, Senegal. Despite being raised as a strict Afrocentrist, Coates had never set foot on the African continent until now. He roams the “steampunk” city of “old traditions and new machinery,” but everywhere he goes he feels as if he’s in two places at once: a modern city in Senegal and a mythic kingdom in his mind. Finally he travels to the slave castles off the coast and has his own reckoning with the legacy of the Afrocentric dream.<br /><br />He takes readers along with him to Columbia, South Carolina, where he meets an educator whose job is threatened for teaching one of Coates’s own books. There he discovers a community of mostly white supporters who were transformed by the “racial reckoning” of 2020. But he also explores the backlash to this reckoning and the deeper myths of the community—a capital of the confederacy with statues of segregationists looming over its public squares.<br /><br />And in Palestine, Coates discovers the devastating gap between the narratives we’ve accepted and the clashing reality of life on the ground. He meets with activists and dissidents, Israelis and Palestinians—the old, who remember their dispossessions on two continents, and the young, who have only known struggle and disillusionment. He travels into Jerusalem, the heart of Zionist mythology, and to the occupied territories, where he sees the reality the myth is meant to hide. It is this hidden story that draws him in and profoundly changes him—and makes the war that would soon come all the more devastating.<br /><br />Written at a dramatic moment in American and global life, this work from one of the country’s most important writers is about the urgent need to untangle ourselves from the destructive nationalist myths that shape our world—and our own souls—and embrace the liberating power of even the most difficult truths.",

      "<b>An Instant #1 <i>New York Times</i> Bestseller<br /><br />From the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author and MSNBC and podcast host, a powerful wide-angle reckoning with how the assault from attention capitalism on our minds and our hearts has reordered our politics and the very fabric of our society<br /><br />“An ambitious analysis of how the trivial amusements offered by online life have degraded not only our selves but also our politics.” —<i>New York Times</i><br /><br />“Brilliant book… Reading it has made me change the way I work and think.”—Rachel Maddow</b><br /><br />We all feel it—the distraction, the loss of focus, the addictive focus on the wrong things for too long. We bump into the zombies on their phones in the street, and sometimes they’re us. We stare in pity at the four people at the table in the restaurant, all on their phones, and then we feel the buzz in our pocket. Something has changed for most of human history, the boundary between public and private has been clear, at least in theory. Now, as Chris Hayes writes, “With the help of a few tech firms, we basically tore it down in about a decade.” Hayes argues that we are in the midst of an epoch-defining transition whose only parallel is what happened to labor in the nineteenth attention has become a commodified resource extracted from us, and from which we are increasingly alienated. <i>The Sirens’ Call</i> is the big-picture vision we urgently need to offer clarity and guidance.<br /><br />Because there is a breaking point. Sirens are designed to compel us, and now they are going off in our bedrooms and kitchens at all hours of the day and night, doing the bidding of vast empires, the most valuable companies in history, built on harvesting human attention. As Hayes writes, “Now our deepest neurological structures, human evolutionary inheritances, and social impulses are in a habitat designed to prey upon, to cultivate, distort, or destroy that which most fundamentally makes us human.” <i>The Sirens’ Call</i> is the book that snaps everything into a single holistic framework so that we can wrest back control of our lives, our politics, and our future.",

    description:
      "<b>From award-winning novelist and journalist Omar El Akkad comes a powerful reckoning with what it means to live in the heart of an Empire which doesn’t consider you fully human.</b><br /><br />On Oct 25th, after just three weeks of the bombardment of Gaza, Omar El Akkad put out a tweet: “One day, when it’s safe, when there’s no personal downside to calling a thing what it is, when it’s too late to hold anyone accountable, everyone will have always been against this.” This tweet was viewed over 10 million times. <br /><br /><i>One Day Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This</i> chronicles the deep fracture which has occurred for Black, brown, indigenous Americans, as well as the upcoming generation, many of whom had clung to a thread of faith in western ideals, in the idea that their countries, or the countries of their adoption, actually attempted to live up to the values they espouse. <br /><br />This book is a reckoning with what it means to live in the west, and what it means to live in a world run by a small group of countries—America, the UK, France and Germany.  It will be<i> The Fire Next Time</i> for a generation that understands we’re undergoing a shift in the so-called ‘rules-based order,’ a generation that understands the west can no longer be trusted to police and guide the world, or its own cities and campuses. It draws on intimate details of Omar’s own story as an emigrant who grew up believing in the western project, who was catapulted into journalism by the rupture of 9/11. <br /><br />This book is his heartsick breakup letter with the west. It is a breakup we are watching all over the U.S., on college campuses, on city streets, and the consequences of this rupture will be felt by all of us. His book is for all the people who want something better than what the west has served up. This is the book for our time.",

      "<b>A fierce international bestseller that launched Korea’s new feminist movement, <i>Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982</i> follows one woman’s psychic deterioration in the face of rigid misogyny.</b><br /><br /><i>Truly, flawlessly, completely, she became that person.</i><br /><br />In a small, tidy apartment on the outskirts of the frenzied metropolis of Seoul lives Kim Jiyoung. A thirtysomething-year-old “millennial everywoman,” she has recently left her white-collar desk job—in order to care for her newborn daughter full-time—as so many Korean women are expected to do. But she quickly begins to exhibit strange symptoms that alarm her husband, parents, and in-laws: Jiyoung impersonates the voices of other women—alive and even dead, both known and unknown to her. As she plunges deeper into this psychosis, her discomfited husband sends her to a male psychiatrist.<br /><br />In a chilling, eerily truncated third-person voice, Jiyoung’s entire life is recounted to the psychiatrist—a narrative infused with disparate elements of frustration, perseverance, and submission. Born in 1982 and given the most common name for Korean baby girls, Jiyoung quickly becomes the unfavored sister to her princeling little brother. Always, her behavior is policed by the male figures around her—from the elementary school teachers who enforce strict uniforms for girls, to the coworkers who install a hidden camera in the women’s restroom and post their photos online. In her father’s eyes, it is Jiyoung’s fault that men harass her late at night; in her husband’s eyes, it is Jiyoung’s duty to forsake her career to take care of him and their child—to put them first.<br /><br />Jiyoung’s painfully common life is juxtaposed against a backdrop of an advancing Korea, as it abandons “family planning” birth control policies and passes new legislation against gender discrimination. But can her doctor flawlessly, completely cure her, or even discover what truly ails her?<br /><br />Rendered in minimalist yet lacerating prose, <i>Kim Jiyoung, Born 1982</i> sits at the center of our global #MeToo movement and announces the arrival of writer of international significance",

      "<b>From the author of <i>Sapiens</i> comes the groundbreaking story of how information networks have made, and unmade, our world.</b><br /><br />For the last 100,000 years, we Sapiens have accumulated enormous power. But despite all our discoveries, inventions, and conquests, we now find ourselves in an existential crisis. The world is on the verge of ecological collapse. Misinformation abounds. And we are rushing headlong into the age of AI—a new information network that threatens to annihilate us. For all that we have accomplished, why are we so self-destructive?<br /><br /><i>Nexus</i> looks through the long lens of human history to consider how the flow of information has shaped us, and our world. Taking us from the Stone Age, through the canonization of the Bible, early modern witch-hunts, Stalinism, Nazism, and the resurgence of populism today, Yuval Noah Harari asks us to consider the complex relationship between information and truth, bureaucracy and mythology, wisdom and power. He explores how different societies and political systems throughout history have wielded information to achieve their goals, for good and ill. And he addresses the urgent choices we face as non-human intelligence threatens our very existence.<br /> <br />Information is not the raw material of truth; neither is it a mere weapon. <i>Nexus</i> explores the hopeful middle ground between these extremes, and in doing so, rediscovers our shared humanity.",

    description:
      '<b>A thrilling story of scientific detective work and medical potential that illuminates the newly understood role of microglia--an elusive type of brain cell that is vitally relevant to our everyday lives.</b><br /><br /><b>"The rarest of books: a combination of page-turning discovery and remarkably readable science journalism."--Mark Hyman, MD, #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Food: What the Heck Should I Eat?</i></b><br /><br />Until recently, microglia were thought to be merely the brain\'s housekeepers, helpfully removing damaged cells. But a recent groundbreaking discovery revealed them to be capable of terrifying Jekyll and Hyde behavior. When triggered--and anything that stirs up the immune system in the body can activate microglia--they can morph into destroyers, impacting a wide range of issues from memory problems and anxiety to depression and Alzheimer\'s. Under the right circumstances, however, microglia can be coaxed back into being angelic healers, able to repair the brain in ways that help alleviate symptoms and hold the promise to one day prevent disease.<br /><br />A fascinating behind-the-scenes account of this cutting-edge science, <i>The Angel and the Assassin</i> also explores the medical implications of these game-changing discoveries. Award-winning journalist Donna Jackson Nakazawa began her investigation with a personal interest--when diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder years ago, she was convinced there was something physical going on in her brain as well as her body, though no doctor she consulted could explain how the two could be interacting in this way. With the compassion born of her own experience, she follows practitioners and patients on the front lines of treatments that help to "reboot" microglia--from neurofeedback and intermittent fasting to transcranial magnetic stimulation and gamma light flicker therapy. She witnesses patients finding significant relief from pressing symptoms--and at least one stunning recovery--offering new hope to the tens of millions who suffer from mental, cognitive, and physical health issues.<br /><br />Proving once and for all the biological basis for the mind-body connection, the discovery of the true role of microglia stands to rewrite psychiatric and medical texts as we know them. Hailed as "riveting," "stunning," and "visionary," <i>The Angel and the Assassin</i> offers us a radically reconceived picture of human health and promises to change everything we thought we knew about how to heal ourselves.',

Ambedkar\'s most prominent speeches on caste and the Indian Constitution. <br /><br />"In the fight for Swaraj, you fight with the whole nation on your side. In fighting caste system, you stand against the whole nation—and that too, your own." <br /><br />Annihilation of Caste is one of Ambedkar\'s best works in putting together how caste as a system has been eating up the roots of a rich cultural melting pot like India. "Bhakti in religion could lead to salvation. But in politics, Bhakti is a sure road to eventual dictatorship." <br /><br />The Grammar of Anarchy reflects Ambedkar\'s ideas on how we need to pave the way for Independent India. It reflects his deep love and aspirations for India and its people. "...the sub-divisions [of caste] have lost the open-door character of the class system, and have become self-enclosed units called castes."<br /><br /> Castes in India: Their Mechanism, Genesis and Development is an in-depth study of how classes went on to become castes and sub-castes to dot the Indian social system. This powerful narrative is a radical eye-opener.',

      "In this candid and riveting memoir, for the first time ever, Nike founder and CEO Phil Knight shares the inside story of the company’s early days as an intrepid start-up and its evolution into one of the world’s most iconic, game-changing, and profitable brands.<br /><br />In 1962, fresh out of business school, Phil Knight borrowed $50 from his father and created a company with a simple mission: import high-quality, low-cost athletic shoes from Japan. Selling the shoes from the trunk of his lime green Plymouth Valiant, Knight grossed $8,000 his first year. Today, Nike’s annual sales top $30 billion. In an age of startups, Nike is the <i>ne plus ultra</i> of all startups, and the swoosh has become a revolutionary, globe-spanning icon, one of the most ubiquitous and recognizable symbols in the world today.<br /><br />But Knight, the man behind the swoosh, has always remained a mystery. Now, for the first time, in a memoir that is candid, humble, gutsy, and wry, he tells his story, beginning with his crossroads moment. At 24, after backpacking around the world, he decided to take the unconventional path, to start his own business—a business that would be dynamic, <i>different.</i><br /><br />Knight details the many risks and daunting setbacks that stood between him and his dream—along with his early triumphs. Above all, he recalls the formative relationships with his first partners and employees, a ragtag group of misfits and seekers who became a tight-knit band of brothers. Together, harnessing the transcendent power of a shared mission, and a deep belief in the spirit of sport, they built a brand that changed everything.",

    description:
      "The Pulitzer Prize–winning, bestselling author of <i>The Warmth of Other Suns</i> examines the unspoken caste system that has shaped America and shows how our lives today are still defined by a hierarchy of human divisions.<br /><br />“As we go about our daily lives, caste is the wordless usher in a darkened theater, flashlight cast down in the aisles, guiding us to our assigned seats for a performance. The hierarchy of caste is not about feelings or morality. It is about power—which groups have it and which do not.”<br /><br />In this brilliant book, Isabel Wilkerson gives us a masterful portrait of an unseen phenomenon in America as she explores, through an immersive, deeply researched narrative and stories about real people, how America today and throughout its history has been shaped by a hidden caste system, a rigid hierarchy of human rankings.<br /><br />Beyond race, class, or other factors, there is a powerful caste system that influences people’s lives and behavior and the nation’s fate. Linking the caste systems of America, India, and Nazi Germany, Wilkerson explores eight pillars that underlie caste systems across civilizations, including divine will, bloodlines, stigma, and more. Using riveting stories about people—including Martin Luther King, Jr., baseball’s Satchel Paige, a single father and his toddler son, Wilkerson herself, and many others—she shows the ways that the insidious undertow of caste is experienced every day. She documents how the Nazis studied the racial systems in America to plan their out-cast of the Jews; she discusses why the cruel logic of caste requires that there be a bottom rung for those in the middle to measure themselves against; she writes about the surprising health costs of caste, in depression and life expectancy, and the effects of this hierarchy on our culture and politics. Finally, she points forward to ways America can move beyond the artificial and destructive separations of human divisions, toward hope in our common humanity.",

      "The most influential book of the past seventy-five years: a groundbreaking exploration of everything we know about what we don’t know, now with a new section called “On Robustness and Fragility.”<br /><br />A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br /> <br />Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don’t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the “impossible.”<br /> <br />For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. In this revelatory book, Taleb will change the way you look at the world, and this second edition features a new philosophical and empirical essay, “On Robustness and Fragility,” which offers tools to navigate and exploit a Black Swan world.<br /><br />Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications, The Black Swan is a landmark book—itself a black swan.",

      "A Nobel Prize–winning scientist reveals biology’s most transformative achievements in decades―a Double Helix for the dawning of the RNA age. Over the last half century, a quiet revolution has taken place. In a series of breathtaking discoveries, biochemist Thomas Cech and a diverse cast of brilliant scientists have revealed RNA at the center of biology’s greatest mysteries, from how life began to what makes us human to why we age. At last, The Catalyst pulls back the curtain to show how RNA―long sidelined as the passive servant of DNA―defines life, from its very origins to our future in the twenty-first century. Recounting his own paradigm-shifting discovery that RNA can catalyze biochemical reactions, as well as his work on the “fountain of youth” telomerase, Cech unfolds how RNA holds the key to the intricate machinery of our cells, the critical processes of aging and disease, and the spectacular powers of breakthrough therapies from CRISPR to mRNA vaccines.

    title: "Skin in the Game: The Hidden Asymmetries in Daily Life",
    description:
      "From the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Black Swan,</i> a bold new work that challenges many of our long-held beliefs about risk and reward, politics and religion, finance and personal responsibility<br /><br /> In his most provocative and practical book yet, one of the foremost thinkers of our time redefines what it means to understand the world, succeed in a profession, contribute to a fair and just society, detect nonsense, and influence others. Citing examples ranging from Hammurabi to Seneca, Antaeus the Giant to Donald Trump, Nassim Nicholas Taleb shows how the willingness to accept one’s own risks is an essential attribute of heroes, saints, and flourishing people in all walks of life.<br /><br /> As always both accessible and iconoclastic, Taleb challenges long-held beliefs about the values of those who spearhead military interventions, make financial investments, and propagate religious faiths. Among his insights:<br /><br /> <b>• <i>For social justice, focus on symmetry and risk sharing. </i></b>You cannot make profits and transfer the risks to others, as bankers and large corporations do. You cannot get rich without owning your own risk and paying for your own losses. Forcing skin in the game corrects this asymmetry better than thousands of laws and regulations.<br /> <b>• <i>Ethical rules aren’t universal</i>.</b> You’re part of a group larger than you, but it’s still smaller than humanity in general.<br /> <b>• <i>Minorities, not majorities, run the world. </i></b>The world is not run by consensus but by stubborn minorities imposing their tastes and ethics on others.<br /> <b>• <i>You can be an intellectual yet still be an idiot</i>.</b> “Educated philistines” have been wrong on everything from Stalinism to Iraq to low-carb diets.<br /> <b>• <i>Beware of complicated solutions (that someone was paid to find)</i>.</b> A simple barbell can build muscle better than expensive new machines.<br /> <b>• <i>True religion is commitment, not just faith</i>.</b> How much you believe in something is manifested only by what you’re willing to risk for it.<br /><br />The phrase “skin in the game” is one we have often heard but rarely stopped to truly dissect. It is the backbone of risk management, but it’s also an astonishingly rich worldview that, as Taleb shows in this book, applies to all aspects of our lives. As Taleb says, “The symmetry of skin in the game is a simple rule that’s necessary for fairness and justice, and the ultimate BS-buster,” and “Never trust anyone who doesn’t have skin in the game. Without it, fools and crooks will benefit, and their mistakes will never come back to haunt them.”",

    description:
      'From the bestselling author of The Black Swan and one of the foremost philosophers of our time, Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a book on how some systems actually benefit from disorder.<br /><br />In The Black Swan Taleb outlined a problem; in <i>Antifragile</i> he offers a definitive solution: how to gain from disorder and chaos while being protected from fragilities and adverse events. For what he calls the "antifragile" is one step beyond robust, as it benefits from adversity, uncertainty and stressors, just as human bones get stronger when subjected to stress and tension.<br /><br />Taleb stands uncertainty on its head, making it desirable, and proposing that things be built in an antifragile manner. Extremely ambitious and multidisciplinary, <i>Antifragile</i> provides a blueprint for how to behave—and thrive—in a world we don\'t understand and which is too uncertain for us to even try to understand. He who is not antifragile will perish. Why is the city state better than the nation state, why is debt bad for you, and why is almost everything modern bound to fail? The book covers innovation, health, biology, medicine, life decisions, politics, foreign policy, urban planning, war, personal finance, and economic systems. Throughout, the voice and recipes of the ancient wisdom from Phoenician, Roman, Greek, and Medieval sources are heard loud and clear.',

Only. Half. I stared at those words. The intent behind the comment was in no way malicious, but it hurt. I felt diminished. I felt like I was being robbed of something essential to me. And as I stared at my screen, realisation dawned. '#bothnothalf' I replied.</i>\n</b><br /><br />For over twenty-five years, actor Jassa Ahluwalia described himself as 'half Indian, half English'. His fluent Punjabi always prompted bewilderment, medical staff questioned the legitimacy of his name, and the world of casting taught him he wasn't 'the right kind of mixed-race'. Feeling caught between two worlds, it wasn't long before Jassa embarked on a call to we need to change how we think and talk about mixed identity.<br /><br />By delving into the media we grew up consuming and the legacies of empire we have been taught, Ahluwalia is there anything to be learnt from Rudyard Kipling? Why were movie stars urged to hide their mixed identities? To what extent did colonialism encourage or hinder mixed marriages? Is nationalism outdated? How can the politics of class and queer liberation inform our understanding of mixed identity?<br /><br /><i>Both Not Half </i>is a rallying cry for a new and inclusive future. It's a journey of self-discovery that unearths the historical roots of modern mixed identity as we know it, braving to deconstruct the binaries we have inherited and the narratives we passively accept.

But in the inevitable condition of aging and death, the goals of medicine seem too frequently to run counter to the interest of the human spirit. Nursing homes, preoccupied with safety, pin patients into railed beds and wheelchairs. Hospitals isolate the dying, checking for vital signs long after the goals of cure have become moot. Doctors, committed to extending life, continue to carry out devastating procedures that in the end extend suffering.<br /><br />Gawande, a practicing surgeon, addresses his profession's ultimate limitation, arguing that quality of life is the desired goal for patients and families. Gawande offers examples of freer, more socially fulfilling models for assisting the infirm and dependent elderly, and he explores the varieties of hospice care to demonstrate that a person's last weeks or months may be rich and dignified.<br /><br />Full of eye-opening research and riveting storytelling, <i>Being Mortal</i> asserts that medicine can comfort and enhance our experience even to the end, providing not only a good life but also a good end.",

      "What is the principle purpose of a brain? A simple question, but the answer has taken millennia for us to begin to understand. So critical for our everyday existence, the brain still remains somewhat of a mystery. Gary L. Wenk takes us on a tour of what we do know about this enigmatic organ, showing us how the workings of the human brain produce our thoughts, feelings, and fears, and answering questions such How did humans evolve such a big brain? What is an emotion and why do we have them? What is a memory and why do we forget so easily? How does your diet affect how you think and feel? What happens when your brain gets old? Throughout human history, ignorance about the brain has caused numerous non-scientific, sometimes harmful interventions to be devised based on interpretations of scientific facts that were misguided. Wenk discusses why these neuroscientific myths are so popular, and why some of the interventions based on them are a waste of time and money. With illuminating insights, gentle humor, and welcome simplicity, The What Everyone Needs to Know? makes the complex biology of our brains accessible to the general reader.",

      "SITA : AN ILLUSTRATED RETELLING OF THE RAMAYANA<br />It is significant that the only character in Hindu mythology, a king at that, to be given the title of ekam-patni-vrata, devoted to a single wife, is associated with the most unjust act of abandoning her in the forest to protect family reputation. This seems a deliberate souring of an uplifting narrative. Rams refusal to remarry to produce a royal heir adds to the complexity. The intention seems to be to provoke thought on notions of fidelity, property and self-image.<br /><br />And so the mythologist and illustrator Devdutt Pattanaik retells the Ramayana, drawing attention to the many oral, visual and written retellings composed in different times, in different places, by different poets, each one trying to solve the puzzle in its own unique way. <br /><br />This book approaches Ram by speculating on Sita: her childhood with her father, Janaka, who hosted sages mentioned in the Upanishads; her stay in the forest with her husband, who had to be a celibate ascetic while she was in the prime of her youth; her interactions with the women of Lanka, recipes she exchanged, emotions they shared; her connection with the earth, her mother, and with the trees, her sisters; her role as the Goddess, the untamed Kali as well as the demure Gauri, in transforming the stoic prince of Ayodhya into God.",

    description:
      "<b>Our most commonly held formula for success is broken.</b><br /><b> </b><br />Conventional wisdom holds that if we work hard we will be more successful, and if we are more successful, <i>then</i> we’ll be happy. If we can just find that great job, win that next promotion, lose those five pounds, happiness will follow. But recent discoveries in the field of positive psychology have shown that this formula is actually backward: Happiness <i>fuels </i>success, not the other way around. When we are positive, our brains become more engaged, creative, motivated, energetic, resilient, and productive at work. This isn’t just an empty mantra. This discovery has been repeatedly borne out by rigorous research in psychology and neuroscience, management studies, and the bottom lines of organizations around the globe. <br />            <br />In <i>The Happiness Advantage</i>, Shawn Achor, who spent over a decade living, researching, and lecturing at Harvard University, draws on his own research—including one of the largest studies of happiness and potential at Harvard and others at companies like UBS and KPMG—to fix this broken formula. Using stories and case studies from his work with thousands of Fortune 500 executives in 42 countries, Achor explains how we can reprogram our brains to become more positive in order to gain a competitive edge at work. <br />            <br />Isolating seven practical, actionable principles that have been tried and tested everywhere from classrooms to boardrooms, stretching from Argentina to Zimbabwe, he shows us how we can capitalize on the Happiness Advantage to improve our performance and maximize our potential. Among the principles he outlines: <br /> <br /><br />    • The Tetris Effect: how to retrain our brains to spot patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunities wherever we look.<br />    • The Zorro Circle: how to channel our efforts on small, manageable goals, to gain the leverage to gradually conquer bigger and bigger ones.<br />    • Social Investment: how to reap the dividends of investing in one of the greatest predictors of success and happiness—our social support network<br /><br />  <br />A must-read for everyone trying to excel in a world of increasing workloads, stress, and negativity, <i>The Happiness Advantage </i>isn’t only about how to become happier at work. It’s about how to reap the benefits of a happier and more positive mind-set to achieve the extraordinary in our work and in our lives.<br /><br /><br /><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>",

The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

    description:
      "Vesalius’s De humani corporis fabrica libri septem, first published in 1543 is, along with William Harvey’s classic work from 1628 on the discovery of the circulation of the blood, one of the two most famous books in the history of medicine. A cornerstone of the scientific revolution, published the same year as Copernicus’s monumental treatise on the heliocentric universe, De humani corporis fabrica inaugurated the modern study of anatomy, leading to the eventual overturn of the Galenic system that had dominated medical science for fourteen centuries. Illustrated with woodcuts by artists in the school of Titian that have for centuries remained standard icons of medical literature, Vesalius’s work is also a classic of sixteenth-century graphic art. When it was originally published in the mid-sixteenth century its Latin text guaranteed its accessibility to an international medical and scientific audience, all of whom had been educated to read and write Latin. Of course, fewer and fewer physicians and scientists read Latin today, and even professional classicists have reported considerable difficulty in deciphering Vesalius’s technical Renaissance medical Latin. Although many editions, revisions, adaptations, and facsimiles of this work appeared over the centuries, remarkably it was never before now translated, except for fragments, into a modern language other than Russian (Moscow, 1950–1954). The Richardson and Carman translation will supply a modern, accessible version of this monumental work for the first time. Readers will be impressed by the quality of the detailed anatomy and may be surprised by the grandeur and elegance of Vesalius’s literary style as rendered by the translators. The third volume in Richardson and Carman’s translation contains the third and fourth books of Vesalius’s Fabrica. Book The Veins and Arteries is made up of fifteen chapters; Book The Nerves of seventeen, for a total of thirty-two chapters. In addition to the numerous woodcuts in the text, the volume reproduces Vesalius’s two magnificent folding illustrations of the blood vessels and of the nerves. The majority of the chapters in both books end with detailed translator’s notes explaining subtleties in the translation. There are also indexes to the arteries, veins, nerves and muscles, to the text, to people and places, to words from Greek and Latin, and to the translator’s notes. Informative and interpretive prefaces by the translator and anatomist provide details about the translation process of the book and anatomy described therein.",

Even after more than three centuries and the revolutions of Einsteinian relativity and quantum mechanics, Newtonian physics continues to account for many of the phenomena of the observed world, and Newtonian celestial dynamics is used to determine the orbits of our space vehicles.<br />This completely new translation, the first in 270 years, is based on the third (1726) edition, the final revised version approved by Newton; it includes extracts from the earlier editions, corrects errors found in earlier versions, and replaces archaic English with contemporary prose and up-to-date mathematical forms. <br />Newton's principles describe acceleration, deceleration, and inertial movement; fluid dynamics; and the motions of the earth, moon, planets, and comets. A great work in itself, the <i>Principia</i> also revolutionized the methods of scientific investigation. It set forth the fundamental three laws of motion and the law of universal gravity, the physical principles that account for the Copernican system of the world as emended by Kepler, thus effectively ending controversy concerning the Copernican planetary system.<br />The illuminating Guide to the <i>Principia</i> by I.

    description:
      "When Dr. Michaeleen Doucleff becomes a mother, she examines the studies behind modern parenting guidance and finds the evidence frustratingly limited and the conclusions often ineffective. Curious to learn about more effective parenting approaches, she visits a Maya village in the Yucatán Peninsula. There she encounters moms and dads who parent in a totally different way than we do—and raise extraordinarily kind, generous, and helpful children without yelling, nagging, or issuing timeouts. What else, Doucleff wonders, are Western parents missing out on?<br /> <br />In <i>Hunt, Gather, Parent</i>, Doucleff sets out with her three-year-old daughter in tow to learn and practice parenting strategies from families in three of the world’s most venerable communities: Maya families in Mexico, Inuit families above the Arctic Circle, and Hadzabe families in Tanzania. She sees that these cultures don’t have the same problems with children that Western parents do. Most strikingly, parents build a relationship with young children that is vastly different from the one many Western parents develop—it’s built on cooperation instead of control, trust instead of fear, and personalized needs instead of standardized development milestones.<br /> <br />Maya parents are masters at raising cooperative children. Without resorting to bribes, threats, or chore charts, Maya parents rear loyal helpers by including kids in household tasks from the time they can walk. Inuit parents have developed a remarkably effective approach for teaching children emotional intelligence. When kids cry, hit, or act out, Inuit parents respond with a calm, gentle demeanor that teaches children how to settle themselves down and think before acting. Hadzabe parents are world experts on raising confident, self-driven kids with a simple tool that protects children from stress and anxiety, so common now among American kids.<br /> <br />Not only does Doucleff live with families and observe their techniques firsthand, she also applies them with her own daughter, with striking results. She learns to discipline without yelling. She talks to psychologists, neuroscientists, anthropologists, and sociologists and explains how these strategies can impact children’s mental health and development. Filled with practical takeaways that parents can implement immediately, <i>Hunt, Gather, Parent</i> helps us rethink the ways we relate to our children, and reveals a universal parenting paradigm adapted for American families.",

      "The Anxious Generation: How the Great Rewiring of Childhood Caused an Epidemic of Mental Illness",
    description:
      "THE INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • A Wall Street Journal Top 10 Book of 2024 • A Washington Post Notable Book • A New York Times Notable Book • The Goodreads Choice Award Nonfiction Book of the Year<br /><br />A must-read for all parents: the generation-defining investigation into the collapse of youth mental health in the era of smartphones, social media, and big tech—and a plan for a healthier, freer childhood.<br /><br />“With tenacity and candor, Haidt lays out the consequences that have come with allowing kids to drift further into the virtual world . . . While also offering suggestions and solutions that could help protect a new generation of kids.” —Shannon Carlin, ,i&gt;TIME, 100 Must-Read Books of 2024<br /><br />After more than a decade of stability or improvement, the mental health of adolescents plunged in the early 2010s. Rates of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide rose sharply, more than doubling on many measures. Why?<br /><br />In <i>The Anxious Generation,</i> social psychologist Jonathan Haidt lays out the facts about the epidemic of teen mental illness that hit many countries at the same time. He then investigates the nature of childhood, including why children need play and independent exploration to mature into competent, thriving adults. Haidt shows how the “play-based childhood” began to decline in the 1980s, and how it was finally wiped out by the arrival of the “phone-based childhood” in the early 2010s. He presents more than a dozen mechanisms by which this “great rewiring of childhood” has interfered with children’s social and neurological development, covering everything from sleep deprivation to attention fragmentation, addiction, loneliness, social contagion, social comparison, and perfectionism. He explains why social media damages girls more than boys and why boys have been withdrawing from the real world into the virtual world, with disastrous consequences for themselves, their families, and their societies.<br /><br />Most important, Haidt issues a clear call to action. He diagnoses the “collective action problems” that trap us, and then proposes four simple rules that might set us free. He describes steps that parents, teachers, schools, tech companies, and governments can take to end the epidemic of mental illness and restore a more humane childhood.<br /><br />Haidt has spent his career speaking truth backed by data in the most difficult landscapes—communities polarized by politics and religion, campuses battling culture wars, and now the public health emergency faced by Gen Z. We cannot afford to ignore his findings about protecting our children—and ourselves—from the psychological damage of a phone-based life.",

    description:
      "Foreword by Steven Pinker<br /><br />Blending the informed analysis of The Signal and the Noise with the instructive iconoclasm of Think Like a Freak, a fascinating, illuminating, and witty look at what the vast amounts of information now instantly available to us reveals about ourselves and our world—provided we ask the right questions.<br /><br />By the end of an average day in the early twenty-first century, human beings searching the internet will amass eight trillion gigabytes of data. This staggering amount of information—unprecedented in history—can tell us a great deal about who we are—the fears, desires, and behaviors that drive us, and the conscious and unconscious decisions we make. From the profound to the mundane, we can gain astonishing knowledge about the human psyche that less than twenty years ago, seemed unfathomable.<br /><br />Everybody Lies offers fascinating, surprising, and sometimes laugh-out-loud insights into everything from economics to ethics to sports to race to sex, gender and more, all drawn from the world of big data. What percentage of white voters didn’t vote for Barack Obama because he’s black? Does where you go to school effect how successful you are in life? Do parents secretly favor boy children over girls? Do violent films affect the crime rate? Can you beat the stock market? How regularly do we lie about our sex lives and who’s more self-conscious about sex, men or women?<br /><br />Investigating these questions and a host of others, Seth Stephens-Davidowitz offers revelations that can help us understand ourselves and our lives better. Drawing on studies and experiments on how we really live and think, he demonstrates in fascinating and often funny ways the extent to which all the world is indeed a lab. With conclusions ranging from strange-but-true to thought-provoking to disturbing, he explores the power of this digital truth serum and its deeper potential—revealing biases deeply embedded within us, information we can use to change our culture, and the questions we’re afraid to ask that might be essential to our health—both emotional and physical. All of us are touched by big data everyday, and its influence is multiplying. Everybody Lies challenges us to think differently about how we see it and the world.",

Who created the MMR hoax? Do journalists understand science? Why do we seek scientific explanations for social, personal and political problems? Are alternative therapists and the pharmaceutical companies really so different, or do they just use the same old tricks to sell different types of pill? <br /><br />We are obsessed with our health. And yet—from the media\'s "world-expert microbiologist" with a mail-order Ph.D. in his garden shed laboratory, via multiple health scares and miracle cures, to the million-pound trial that Durham Council now denies ever existed—we are constantly bombarded with inaccurate, contradictory and sometimes even misleading information. Until now. <br /><br />Ben Goldacre masterfully dismantles the dodgy science behind some of the great drug trials, court cases and missed opportunities of our time, but he also goes further: out of the bullshit, he shows us the fascinating story of how we know what we know, and gives us the tools to uncover bad science for ourselves.',

These techniques don't build the skills kids need for life, or account for their complex emotional needs.

It wasn't until he moved to the UK that Kisin found himself thriving in an open and tolerant society, receiving countless opportunities he would never have had otherwise.<br /><br />Funny, provocative and unswervingly perceptive, An Immigrant's Love letter to the West interrogates the developing sense of self-loathing the Western sphere has adopted and offers an alternative perspective. Exploring race politics, free speech, immigration and more, Kisin argues that wrongdoing and guilt need not pervade how we feel about the West - and Britain - today, and that despite all its ups and downs, it remains one of the best places to live in the world.<br /><br />After all, if an immigrant can't publicly profess their appreciation for this country, who can?",

    description:
      'The Simulation Hypothesis, by best-selling author, renowned MIT computer scientist and Silicon Valley video game designer Rizwan Virk, is the first serious book to explain one of the most daring and consequential theories of our time. Riz is the Executive Director of Play Labs @ MIT, a video game startup incubator at the MIT Game Lab.<br /><br />Drawing from research and concepts from computer science, artificial intelligence, video games, quantum physics, and referencing both speculative fiction and ancient eastern spiritual texts, Virk shows how all of these traditions come together to point to the idea that we may be inside a simulated reality like the Matrix.<br /><br />The Simulation Hypothesis is the idea that our physical reality, far from being a solid physical universe, is part of an increasingly sophisticated video game-like simulation, where we all have multiple lives, consisting of pixels with its own internal clock run by some giant Artificial Intelligence. Simulation theory explains some of the biggest mysteries of quantum and relativistic physics, such as quantum indeterminacy, parallel universes, and the integral nature of the speed of light.<br /><br />Recently, the idea that we may be living in a giant video game has received a lot of attention:<br /><br />"There\'s a one in a billion chance we are not living in a simulation" -Elon Musk<br /><br />"I find it hard to argue we are not in a simulation." -Neil deGrasse Tyson<br /><br />"We are living in computer generated reality." -Philip K. Dick<br /><br />Video game technology has developed from basic arcade and text adventures to MMORPGs. Video game designer Riz Virk shows how these games may continue to evolve in the future, including virtual reality, augmented reality, Artificial Intelligence, and quantum computing. This book shows how this evolution could lead us to the point of being able to develop all encompassing virtual worlds like the Oasis in Ready Player One, or the simulated reality in the Matrix.<br /><br />While the idea sounds like science fiction, many scientists, engineers, and professors have given the Simulation Hypothesis serious consideration. Futurist Ray Kurzweil has popularized the idea of downloading our consciousness into a silicon based device, which would mean we are just digital information after all. Some, like Oxford lecturer Nick Bostrom, goes further and thinks we may in fact be artificially intelligent consciousness inside such a simulation already!<br /><br />But the Simulation Hypothesis is not just a modern idea. Philosophers like Plato have been telling us that we live in a "cave" and can only see shadows of the real world. Mystics of all traditions have long contended that we are living in some kind of "illusion "and that there are other realities which we can access with our minds. While even Judeo-Christian traditions have this idea, Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism make this idea part of their core tradition -- that we are inside a dream world ("Maya" or illusion, or Vishnu\'s Dream), and we have "multiple lives" playing different characters when one dies, continuing to gain experience and "level up" after completing certain challenges. Sounds a lot like a video game!<br /><br />Whether you are a computer scientist, a fan of science fiction like the Matrix movies, a video game enthusiast, or a spiritual seeker, The Simulation Hypothesis touches on all these areas, and you will never look at the world the same way again!<br />',

His absorbing life story thus becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence. <br /><br />Considered a modern spiritual classic, the book has been translated into more than twenty languages and is widely used as a text and reference work in colleges and universities.

      "Why are we obsessed with the things we want and bored when we get them? <br />Why is addiction \"perfectly logical\" to an addict? <br />Why does love change so quickly from passion to indifference? <br />Why are some people diehard liberals and others hardcore conservatives? <br />Why are we always hopeful for solutions even in the darkest times--and so good at figuring them out? <br /><br />The answer is found in a single chemical in your brain: dopamine. Dopamine ensured the survival of early man. Thousands of years later, it is the source of our most basic behaviors and cultural ideas--and progress itself. <br /><br />Dopamine is the chemical of desire that always asks for more--more stuff, more stimulation, and more surprises. In pursuit of these things, it is undeterred by emotion, fear, or morality. Dopamine is the source of our every urge, that little bit of biology that makes an ambitious business professional sacrifice everything in pursuit of success, or that drives a satisfied spouse to risk it all for the thrill of someone new. Simply put, it is why we seek and succeed; it is why we discover and prosper. Yet, at the same time, it's why we gamble and squander. <br /><br />From dopamine's point of view, it's not the having that matters. It's getting something--anything--that's new. From this understanding--the difference between possessing something versus anticipating it--we can understand in a revolutionary new way why we behave as we do in love, business, addiction, politics, religion - and we can even predict those behaviors in ourselves and others. <br /><br />In The Molecule of More: How a Single Chemical in Your Brain Drives Love, Sex, and Creativity--and will Determine the Fate of the Human Race, George Washington University professor and psychiatrist Daniel Z.

      'Disruption resulting from the proliferation of AI is coming. The authors of the bestselling Prediction Machines describe what you can do to prepare.<br /><br />Banking and finance, pharmaceuticals, automotive, medical technology, retail. Artificial intelligence (AI) has made its way into many industries around the world. But the truth is, it has just begun its odyssey toward cheaper, better, and faster predictions to drive strategic business decisions--powering and accelerating business. When prediction is taken to the max, industries transform. The disruption that comes with such transformation is yet to be felt--but it is coming.<br /><br />How do businesses prepare? In their bestselling first book, Prediction Machines, eminent economists Ajay Agrawal, Joshua Gans, and Avi Goldfarb explained the simple yet game-changing economics of AI. Now, in Power and Prediction, they go further to reveal AI as a prediction technology directly impacting decision-making and to teach businesses how to identify disruptive opportunities and threats resulting from AI. Their exhaustive study of new developments in artificial intelligence and the past history of how technologies have disrupted industries highlights the striking phase we are now in: after witnessing the power of this new technology and before its widespread adoption--what they call "the Between Times." While there continue to be important opportunities for businesses, there are also threats of disruption. As prediction machines improve, old ways of doing things will be upended. Also, the process by which AI filters into the many systems involved in application is very uneven. That process will have winners and losers. How can businesses leverage, or protect, their positions?<br /><br />Filled with illuminating insights, rich examples, and practical advice, Power and Prediction is the must-read guide for any business leader or policy maker on how to make the coming AI disruptions work for you rather than against you.',

    title: "Antimatter",
    description:
      'Of all the mind-bending discoveries of physics--quarks, black holes, strange attractors, curved space--the existence of antimatter is one of the most bizarre. It is also one of the most difficult, literally and figuratively, to grasp. <br /> <br /> <em>Antimatter</em> explores this strange mirror world, where particles have identical yet opposite properties to those that make up the familiar matter we encounter everyday, where left becomes right, positive becomes negative, and where--should matter and antimatter meet--the resulting flash of blinding energy would make even thermonuclear explosions look feeble by comparison. Antimatter is an idea long beloved of science-fiction writers--but here, renowned science writer Frank Close shows that the reality of antimatter is even more intriguing than the fiction. We know that at one time antimatter and matter existed in perfect counterbalance, and that antimatter then perpetrated a vanishing act on a cosmic scale that remains one of the great mysteries of the universe. Today, antimatter does not exist normally, at least on Earth, but we know that it is real, as scientists are now able to make small pieces of it in particle accelerators, such as that at CERN in Geneva. Looking at the remarkable prediction of antimatter and how it grew from the meeting point of relativity and quantum theory in the early 20th century, at the discovery of the first antiparticles, at cosmic rays, annihilation, antimatter bombs, and antiworlds, Close separates the facts from the fiction about antimatter, and explains how its existence can give us profound clues about the origins and structure of the universe.<br /> <br /> For all those wishing to take a closer look at the flip side of the visible world, this lucidly written book shines a bright light into a truly strange realm. <br /> <br /> "Beautifully written... This book will inspire a sense of awe in even the most seasoned of physics readers."<br /> --Amanda Gefter, <em>New Scientist</em><br /> <br /> "This is a must read for fans of science and science fiction alike." --John Gribbin, <em><a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow" href="http://www.bbcfocusmagazine.com">www.bbcfocusmagazine.com</a></em>',

    description:
      "<i>The dinosaurs</i>. Sixty-six million years ago, the Earth’s most fearsome creatures vanished. Today they remain one of our planet’s great mysteries. Now <i>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs</i> reveals their extraordinary, 200-million-year-long story as never before.<br /><br />In this captivating narrative (enlivened with more than seventy original illustrations and photographs), Steve Brusatte, a young American paleontologist who has emerged as one of the foremost stars of the field—naming fifteen new species and leading groundbreaking scientific studies and fieldwork—masterfully tells the complete, surprising, and new history of the dinosaurs, drawing on cutting-edge science to dramatically bring to life their lost world and illuminate their enigmatic origins, spectacular flourishing, astonishing diversity, cataclysmic extinction, and startling living legacy. Captivating and revelatory, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs</i> is a book for the ages.<br /><br />Brusatte traces the evolution of dinosaurs from their inauspicious start as small shadow dwellers—themselves the beneficiaries of a mass extinction caused by volcanic eruptions at the beginning of the Triassic period—into the dominant array of species every wide-eyed child memorizes today, <i>T. rex</i>, <i>Triceratops</i>, <i>Brontosaurus</i>, and more. This gifted scientist and writer re-creates the dinosaurs’ peak during the Jurassic and Cretaceous, when thousands of species thrived, and winged and feathered dinosaurs, the prehistoric ancestors of modern birds, emerged. The story continues to the end of the Cretaceous period, when a giant asteroid or comet struck the planet and nearly every dinosaur species (but not all) died out, in the most extraordinary extinction event in earth’s history, one full of lessons for today as we confront a “sixth extinction.”<br /><br />Brusatte also recalls compelling stories from his globe-trotting expeditions during one of the most exciting eras in dinosaur research—which he calls “a new golden age of discovery”—and offers thrilling accounts of some of the remarkable findings he and his colleagues have made, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs; monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex; and paradigm-shifting feathered raptors from China.<br /><br />An electrifying scientific history that unearths the dinosaurs’ epic saga, <i>The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs</i> will be a definitive and treasured account for decades to come.<br /><br /><b>Includes 75 images, world maps of the prehistoric earth, and a dinosaur family tree.</b>",

    description:
      "In this groundbreaking addition to his New York Times bestselling Plant Paradox series, Steven R.Gundry, MD offers a definitive guide to the gut biome and its control over its home — us! — revealing the unimaginably complex and intelligent ecosystem controlling our health and teaching us how to heal our guts to prevent and reverse every type of disease. We may believe that we are the masters of our fates, but in reality, we are at the mercy of hundreds of trillions of single-celled organisms that exert control over every aspect of how our minds and bodies function. These are the diverse species of microbes living in our guts, mouths, and skin that work together synergistically to communicate with each other and with every system in our bodies. You are your microbiome’s home, and it wants to take care of you, but first you have to protect it. In Gut Check , Dr. Steven Gundry reveals the emerging science proving that Hippocrates was right – all disease begins in the gut. When our microbiomes are out of balance, it affects our immune systems, our hormone levels, our mental health, our longevity, and our risk of developing autoimmunity, heart, and neurodegenerative disease, as well as arthritis, diabetes, and cancer. Yet, not all hope is disease can also be healed in the gut if we choose to treat our microbes right. In Gut Check , Dr. Gundry shows us how.   In his warm, authoritative voice, Dr. Gundry provides us with the keys to unlocking our gut health, allowing our bodies, and its microbiome, to function at their highest potential. Sharing shocking new research as well as a detailed eating plan with food lists and recipes to heal and rebalance the microbiome, Gut Check provides the cutting-edge information and tools we need to repair our health and reclaim our lives.",

As these divides deepen, we have lost the sense of ethical obligation to others that was crucial to the rise of post-war social democracy. So far these rifts have been answered only by the revivalist ideologies of populism and socialism, leading to the seismic upheavals of Trump, Brexit, and the return of the far-right in Germany. We have heard many critiques of capitalism but no one has laid out a realistic way to fix it, until now.<br /><br />In a passionate and polemical book, celebrated economist Paul Collier outlines brilliantly original and ethical ways of healing these rifts—economic, social and cultural—with the cool head of pragmatism, rather than the fervor of ideological revivalism. He reveals how he has personally lived across these three divides, moving from working-class Sheffield to hyper-competitive Oxford, and working between Britain and Africa, and acknowledges some of the failings of his profession.<br /><br />Drawing on his own solutions as well as ideas from some of the world’s most distinguished social scientists, he shows us how to save capitalism from itself—and free ourselves from the intellectual baggage of the twentieth century.",

Oh, and took over Twitter.</b><br /><br />When Elon Musk was a kid in South Africa, he was regularly beaten by bullies. One day a group pushed him down some concrete steps and kicked him until his face was a swollen ball of flesh. He was in the hospital for a week. But the physical scars were minor compared to the emotional ones inflicted by his father, an engineer, rogue, and charismatic fantasist.<br /><br />His father’s impact on his psyche would linger. He developed into a tough yet vulnerable man-child, prone to abrupt Jekyll-and-Hyde mood swings, with an exceedingly high tolerance for risk, a craving for drama, an epic sense of mission, and a maniacal intensity that was callous and at times destructive.<br /><br />At the beginning of 2022—after a year marked by SpaceX launching thirty-one rockets into orbit, Tesla selling a million cars, and him becoming the richest man on earth—Musk spoke ruefully about his compulsion to stir up dramas. “I need to shift my mindset away from being in crisis mode, which it has been for about fourteen years now, or arguably most of my life,” he said.<br /><br />It was a wistful comment, not a New Year’s resolution. Even as he said it, he was secretly buying up shares of Twitter, the world’s ultimate playground. Over the years, whenever he was in a dark place, his mind went back to being bullied on the playground. Now he had the chance to own the playground.<br /><br />For two years, Isaacson shadowed Musk, attended his meetings, walked his factories with him, and spent hours interviewing him, his family, friends, coworkers, and adversaries.

      '<b>#1 New York Times bestseller<br /><br />"This brilliant book will shatter your assumptions about what it takes to improve and succeed. I wish I could go back in time and gift it to my younger self. It would\'ve helped me find a more joyful path to progress."<br />-Serena Williams, 23-time Grand Slam singles tennis champion<br /><br />The #1 New York Times bestselling author of Think Again illuminates how we can elevate ourselves and others to unexpected heights.</b><br /><br />We live in a world that’s obsessed with talent. We celebrate gifted students in school, natural athletes in sports, and child prodigies in music. But admiring people who start out with innate advantages leads us to overlook the distances we ourselves can travel. We can all improve at improving. And when opportunity doesn’t knock, there are ways to build a door.<br /><br />Hidden Potential offers a new framework for raising aspirations and exceeding expectations. Adam Grant weaves together groundbreaking evidence, surprising insights, and vivid story­telling that takes us from the classroom to the boardroom, the playground to the Olympics, and underground to outer space. He shows that progress depends less on how hard you work than how well you learn. Growth is not about the genius you possess – it’s about the character you develop. Grant explores how to build the charac­ter skills and motivational structures to realize our own potential, and how to design systems that create opportunities for those who have been underrated and overlooked.<br /><br />This book reveals how anyone can rise to achieve greater things. The true measure of your potential is not the height of the peak you’ve reached, but how far you’ve climbed to get there.',

    description:
      "<b>From the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Boys in the Boat</i>, a gripping World War II saga of patriotism and courage: the special Japanese-American Army unit that overcame brutal odds in Europe; their families, incarcerated back home; and a young man who refused to surrender his constitutional rights, even if it meant imprisonment.</b><br /><br />They came from across the continent and Hawaii. Their parents taught them to embrace both their Japanese heritage and the ways of their American homeland. They faced bigotry, yet they believed in their bright futures as American citizens. But within days of Pearl Harbor, the FBI was ransacking their houses and locking up their fathers. And within months many would themselves be living behind barbed wire.<br /><br /><i>Facing the Mountain</i> is an unforgettable chronicle of war-time America and the battlefields of Europe. Based on Daniel James Brown's extensive interviews with the families of the protagonists as well as deep archival research, it portrays the kaleidoscopic journey of four Japanese-American families and their sons, who volunteered for 442nd Regimental Combat Team and were deployed to France, Germany, and Italy, where they were asked to do the near impossible.<br /><br />But this is more than a war story. Brown also tells the story of these soldiers' parents, immigrants who were forced to shutter the businesses, surrender their homes, and submit to life in concentration camps on U.S. soil. Woven throughout is the chronicle of a brave young man, one of a cadre of patriotic resisters who stood up against their government in defense of their own rights. Whether fighting on battlefields or in courtrooms, these were Americans under unprecedented strain, doing what Americans do best--striving, resisting, pushing back, rising up, standing on principle, laying down their lives, and enduring.",

      "<b>Malcolm Gladwell, host of the podcast Revisionist History and author of the #1 New York Times bestseller <i>Outliers</i>, offers a powerful examination of our interactions with strangers -- and why they often go wrong.</b><br /><br />How did Fidel Castro fool the CIA for a generation? Why did Neville Chamberlain think he could trust Adolf Hitler? Why are campus sexual assaults on the rise? Do television sitcoms teach us something about the way we relate to each other that isn't true?<br /><br />While tackling these questions, Malcolm Gladwell was not solely writing a book for the page. He was also producing for the ear. In the audiobook version of Talking to Strangers, you'll hear the voices of people he interviewed--scientists, criminologists, military psychologists. Court transcripts are brought to life with re-enactments. You actually hear the contentious arrest of Sandra Bland by the side of the road in Texas. As Gladwell revisits the deceptions of Bernie Madoff, the trial of Amanda Knox, and the suicide of Sylvia Plath, you hear directly from many of the players in these real-life tragedies. There's even a theme song - Janelle Monae's \"Hell You Talmbout.\"<br /><br />Something is very wrong, Gladwell argues, with the tools and strategies we use to make sense of people we don't know. And because we don't know how to talk to strangers, we are inviting conflict and misunderstanding in ways that have a profound effect on our lives and our world.",

      "Jack Reacher. Hero. Loner. Soldier. Soldier’s son. An elite military cop, he was one of the army’s brightest stars. But in every cop’s life there is a turning point. One case. One messy, tangled case that can shatter a career. Turn a lawman into a renegade. And make him question words like honor, valor, and duty. For Jack Reacher, this is that case.<br /><br />New Year’s Day, 1990. The Berlin Wall is coming down. The world is changing. And in a North Carolina “hot-sheets” motel, a two-star general is found dead. His briefcase is missing. Nobody knows what was in it. Within minutes Jack Reacher has his orders: Control the situation. But this situation can’t be controlled. Within hours the general’s wife is murdered hundreds of miles away. Then the dominoes really start to fall.<br /><br />Two Special Forces soldiers—the toughest of the tough—are taken down, one at a time. Top military commanders are moved from place to place in a bizarre game of chess. And somewhere inside the vast worldwide fortress that is the U.S. Army, Jack Reacher—an ordinarily untouchable investigator for the 110th Special Unit—is being set up as a fall guy with the worst enemies a man can have.<br /><br />But Reacher won’t quit. He’s fighting a new kind of war. And he’s taking a young female lieutenant with him on a deadly hunt that leads them from the ragged edges of a rural army post to the winding streets of Paris to a confrontation with an enemy he didn’t know he had. With his French-born mother dying—and divulging to her son one last, stunning secret—Reacher is forced to question everything he once believed…about his family, his career, his loyalties—and himself. Because this soldier’s son is on his way into the darkness, where he finds a tangled drama of desperate desires and violent death—and a conspiracy more chilling, ingenious, and treacherous than anyone could have guessed.",

      "The investment profession is in a state of crisis. The vast majority of equity fund managers are unable to beat the market over the long term, which has led to massive outflows from active funds to passive funds. Where should investors turn in search of a new approach?<br /><br />Pulak Prasad offers a philosophy of patient long-term investing based on an unexpected source: evolutionary biology. He draws key lessons from core Darwinian concepts, mixing vivid examples from the natural world with compelling stories of good and bad investing decisions―including his own. How can bumblebees’ survival strategies help us accept that we might miss out on Tesla? What does an experiment in breeding tame foxes reveal about the traits of successful businesses? Why might a small frog’s mimicry of the croak of a larger rival shed light on the signs of corporate dishonesty?<br /><br />Informed by successful evolutionary strategies, Prasad outlines his counterintuitive principles for long-term gain. He provides three mantras of investing: Avoid big risks; buy high quality at a fair price; and don’t be lazy―be very lazy. Prasad makes a persuasive case for a strategy that rules out the vast majority of investment opportunities and advocates permanently owning high-quality businesses.<br /><br />Combining punchy prose and practical insight, What I Learned About Investing from Darwin reveals why evolutionary biology can help fund managers become better at their craft.",

Before the frequent hospital visits and stints in rehab, there was five-year-old Matthew, who traveled from Montreal to Los Angeles, shuffling between his separated parents; fourteen-year-old Matthew, who was a nationally ranked tennis star in Canada; twenty-four-year-old Matthew, who nabbed a coveted role as a lead cast member on the talked-about pilot then called <i>Friends Like Us</i>. . . and so much more.<br /><br />In an extraordinary story that only he could tell—and in the heartfelt, hilarious, and warmly familiar way only he could tell it—Matthew Perry lays bare the fractured family that raised him (and also left him to his own devices), the desire for recognition that drove him to fame, and the void inside him that could not be filled even by his greatest dreams coming true. But he also details the peace he’s found in sobriety and how he feels about the ubiquity of <i>Friends</i>, sharing stories about his castmates and other stars he met along the way. Frank, self-aware, and with his trademark humor, Perry vividly depicts his lifelong battle with addiction and what fueled it despite seemingly having it all.<br /><br /><i>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</i> is an unforgettable memoir that is both intimate and eye-opening—as well as a hand extended to anyone struggling with sobriety. Unflinchingly honest, moving, and uproariously funny, this is the book fans have been waiting for.",

How would looking at the full span of time change the way we perceive the universe, the earth, and our very existence?<br /><br />These were the questions David Christian set out to answer when he created the field of "Big History," the most exciting new approach to understanding where we have been, where we are, and where we are going. In <i>Origin Story</i>, Christian takes readers on a wild ride through the entire 13.8 billion years we\'ve come to know as "history." By focusing on defining events (thresholds), major trends, and profound questions about our origins, Christian exposes the hidden threads that tie everything together -- from the creation of the planet to the advent of agriculture, nuclear war, and beyond.<br /><br />With stunning insights into the origin of the universe, the beginning of life, the emergence of humans, and what the future might bring, <i>Origin Story</i> boldly reframes our place in the cosmos.<br /><br />',

This revelation propels the hysterical, heartbreaking action of How to Stay Married , casting our narrator onto “the factory floor of hell,” where his wife was now in love with a man who “wears cargo shorts, on purpose.” What will he do?

Through an absurd series of escalating confessions and betrayals, Harrison reckons with his failure to love his wife in the ways she needed most, resolves to fight for his family, and in a climax almost too ridiculous to be believed, finally learns that love is no joke. <i>How to Stay Married</i> is a comic romp unlike any in contemporary literature, a wild Pilgrim’s Progress through the hellscape of marriage and the mysteries of mercy.",

People struggled to come up with someone, anyone, who truly listened to them without glazing over, glancing down at a phone, or jumping in to offer an opinion. Many admitted that they, themselves, weren’t very good listeners, and most couldn’t even describe what it meant to be a good listener.<br /><br />Despite living in a world where technology allows constant digital communication and opportunities to connect, it seems no one is really listening or even knows how. And it’s making us lonelier, more isolated, and less tolerant than ever before. A listener by trade, Murphy wanted to know how we got here.<br /><br />In this illuminating and often humorous deep dive, Murphy explains why we’re not listening, what it’s doing to us, and how we can reverse the trend. She makes accessible the psychology, neuroscience, and sociology of listening while also introducing us to some of the best listeners out there (including a CIA agent, focus-group moderator, bartender, radio producer, and top furniture salesman).<br /><br />While listening is often regarded as talking’s meek counterpart, Murphy discovered it’s actually the more powerful position in communication. We learn when we listen. It’s how we connect, cooperate, empathize, and fall in love. Listening is something we do or don’t do every day. While we might take listening for granted, how well we listen, to whom, and under what circumstances determines who we are and the paths we take in life.<br /><br />Equal parts cultural observation, scientific exploration, and rousing call to action that’s full of practical advice, <i>You’re Not Listening</i> is to listening what Susan Cain’s <i>Quiet</i> was to introversion.

Gates says, "we can work on a local, national, and global level to build the technologies, businesses, and industries to avoid the worst impacts of climate change." His interest in climate change is a natural outgrowth of the efforts by his foundation to reduce poverty and disease. Climate change, according to Gates, will have the biggest impact on the people who have done the least to cause it. As a technologist, he has seen first-hand how innovation can change the world. By investing in research, inventing new technologies, and by deploying them quickly at large scale, Gates believes climate change can be addressed in meaningful ways. According to Gates, "to prevent the worst effects of climate change, we have to get to net-zero emissions of greenhouse gases. This problem is urgent, and the debate is complex, but I believe we can come together to invent new carbon-zero technologies, deploy the ones we have, and ultimately avoid a climate catastrophe."',

Michael Lewis’s taut and brilliant nonfiction thriller pits a band of medical visionaries against the wall of ignorance that was the official response of the Trump administration to the outbreak of COVID-19.<br /><br />The characters you will meet in these pages are as fascinating as they are unexpected. A thirteen-year-old girl’s science project on transmission of an airborne pathogen develops into a very grown-up model of disease control. A local public-health officer uses her worm’s-eye view to see what the CDC misses, and reveals great truths about American society. A secret team of dissenting doctors, nicknamed the Wolverines, has everything necessary to fight the pandemic: brilliant backgrounds, world-class labs, prior experience with the pandemic scares of bird flu and swine flu…everything, that is, except official permission to implement their work.<br /><br />Michael Lewis is not shy about calling these people heroes for their refusal to follow directives that they know to be based on misinformation and bad science. Even the internet, as crucial as it is to their exchange of ideas, poses a risk to them. They never know for sure who else might be listening in.",
